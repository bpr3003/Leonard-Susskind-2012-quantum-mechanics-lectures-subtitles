1
00:00:05,415 --> 00:00:07,287
Stanford University 

2
00:00:10,463 --> 00:00:12,808
Going way beyond the course 

3
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:21,312
The model we talk about is Hamiltonian for energy

4
00:00:21,564 --> 00:00:23,670
Is just C time P

5
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:30,105
P could be positive or negative 

6
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:35,913
The wave function for a given P is just e to the IPX

7
00:00:37,266 --> 00:00:43,328
And is nothing better about e to the plus IPX 

8
00:00:43,552 --> 00:00:49,095
Or P being positive or negative they are both perfectly acceptable plain waves

9
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,875
But one of them has positive energy 

10
00:00:52,102 --> 00:00:53,282
And one of them has negative energy

11
00:00:56,158 --> 00:00:58,248
Just reading off here

12
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:04,780
Now negative energy is not such a good thing in the real world 

13
00:01:05,029 --> 00:01:07,805
Negative energy is not such a good thing in the real world 

14
00:01:08,037 --> 00:01:13,347
because if there were particles of negative energy 

15
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:18,620
The world will be unstable the vacuum would not be,

16
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:23,200
an empty space would not be the state of lowest energy 

17
00:01:23,437 --> 00:01:29,100
you could take empty space which we could say has zero energy 

18
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:32,711
and just start putting in particles of negative energy 

19
00:01:32,936 --> 00:01:36,276
Particles of negative energy will lower the energy and 

20
00:01:36,521 --> 00:01:41,051
anything that lowers the energy tends to be favored 

21
00:01:41,265 --> 00:01:44,163
You can make lots and lots particles, more and more particles 

22
00:01:44,407 --> 00:01:45,826
more and more negative energy 

23
00:01:47,356 --> 00:01:50,275
you have to get some positive energy from someplace 

24
00:01:51,602 --> 00:01:53,430
You have to get some positive energy from someplace 

25
00:01:53,704 --> 00:01:55,851
But you could for example radiate photons 

26
00:01:56,098 --> 00:01:59,418
And at the same time produce more and more of these negative energy 

27
00:01:59,645 --> 00:02:02,971
Particles, if there were particles of negative energy

28
00:02:03,193 --> 00:02:05,917
The empty space would just be unstable 

29
00:02:06,123 --> 00:02:09,250
Unstable with respect to creating more and more 

30
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:13,576
positive and negative energy particles 

31
00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:17,202
You can, you have to conserve energy so you have to do both 

32
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,941
If there is only positive energy particles by contrast 

33
00:02:22,194 --> 00:02:29,086
there is no way that energy conservation will allow you to make them 

34
00:02:29,326 --> 00:02:33,497
If they are the only positive energy particles in the vacuum has zero energy 

35
00:02:33,731 --> 00:02:37,654
it's the lowest energy state and nothing can happen to it to create particles

36
00:02:37,654 --> 00:02:43,808
so good stable world requires all particles to have positive energy 

37
00:02:44,055 --> 00:02:47,204
relative to the vacuum, this is not a good stable world 

38
00:02:47,404 --> 00:02:50,278
okay so what you do about it? 

39
00:02:50,495 --> 00:02:55,696
Well it was Dirac who understood what to do about it 

40
00:02:55,912 --> 00:02:59,587
but only in the case of fermions, now what are the fermions?

41
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:04,747
Fermions are simply particles that cannot be in the same state

42
00:03:05,003 --> 00:03:06,925
Two of them cannot be in the same state 

43
00:03:07,172 --> 00:03:09,744
That's a rule, where that rule came from?

44
00:03:09,997 --> 00:03:13,059
It comes from relativistic quantum field theory 

45
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:17,907
But it's the same as the Pauli exclusion principle 

46
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:20,213
If you know a little bit about chemistry 

47
00:03:20,426 --> 00:03:23,597
you know that the two electrons in an atom can't be in the same state 

48
00:03:25,183 --> 00:03:31,623
and you have to fill the atoms with particles of different energies 

49
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:36,507
Different states, and the same is generally true 

50
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:41,658
Particles that participate in the Pauli exclusion principle 

51
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,049
are called fermions 

52
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,129
Why are they called fermions I don't know 

53
00:03:45,338 --> 00:03:48,675
They should be called Pauli-on such obviously should be called Pauli-ons

54
00:03:48,969 --> 00:03:54,024
And particles which don't participate in a exclusion principle 

55
00:03:54,246 --> 00:03:59,661
are called bosons, but of course properly they should be called Einstein-ons 

56
00:03:59,876 --> 00:04:02,295
But it was Einstein for studying them

57
00:04:03,797 --> 00:04:09,130
Nevermind, fermions and bosons, fermions can't be put in the same state 

58
00:04:09,356 --> 00:04:13,473
bosons can, so Dirac said, look I have a very simple solution to all of this

59
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:17,531
just imagine that the vacuum empty space 

60
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:22,053
is really a state in which all the particles of negative energy 

61
00:04:22,323 --> 00:04:26,074
are present simultaneously filling up the vacuum 

62
00:04:26,316 --> 00:04:30,128
you simply can't put any more in because you are not allowed 

63
00:04:30,364 --> 00:04:32,484
to put particles in the same state

64
00:04:32,484 --> 00:04:34,511
but everything else is empty 

65
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:38,548
In fact if you were to say, think about that for moment 

66
00:04:38,763 --> 00:04:44,774
let's assume that the real vacuum is a state of absolute lowest energy 

67
00:04:46,464 --> 00:04:49,649
absolute lowest energy, now take absolute empty space 

68
00:04:49,926 --> 00:04:52,356
would you think of is ordinarily empty space? 

69
00:04:52,578 --> 00:04:53,949
Is that the state of lowest energy?

70
00:04:54,178 --> 00:04:58,811
No, I can put one particle of negative energy in, lower the energy 

71
00:04:59,017 --> 00:05:02,311
So there are state of lower energy 

72
00:05:02,545 --> 00:05:07,478
Whatever state you say I will find another negative energy particles to put into it

73
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,143
and lower its energy,

74
00:05:10,353 --> 00:05:13,586
the only way to have the state of absolute lowest energy 

75
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:19,385
is to simply fill it, full, full of all the particles which have negative energy 

76
00:05:19,642 --> 00:05:22,103
another words all the particles with negative momentum 

77
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,055
sounds crazy but it turned out to be right 

78
00:05:27,309 --> 00:05:31,823
but you can only do that with particles which have the property 

79
00:05:32,056 --> 00:05:34,802
that you can't put more than one of them into the same state 

80
00:05:35,066 --> 00:05:39,424
If you can put more than one into the same state it would be no inability 

81
00:05:39,685 --> 00:05:42,859
to keep dumping negative energy particles into the vacuum 

82
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:49,069
so this is a reasonable theory, it's Dirac's

83
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:55,236
It's a very simple basic baby version of the Dirac equation of what it is 

84
00:05:56,604 --> 00:06:00,680
and it's okay theory for neutrinos 

85
00:06:00,909 --> 00:06:04,348
Or for one-dimensional neutrinos 

86
00:06:04,579 --> 00:06:07,016
It is not a good theory for photons 

87
00:06:07,316 --> 00:06:13,113
photons are bosons and you simply can't play the same game 

88
00:06:13,343 --> 00:06:15,450
if there were negative energy bosons 

89
00:06:15,658 --> 00:06:17,781
you could simply dump them into the same state 

90
00:06:17,997 --> 00:06:20,961
more and more and more of them, it would simply destabilize the world 

91
00:06:21,216 --> 00:06:24,097
So no this is not good theory of bosons

92
00:06:24,327 --> 00:06:26,405
It's a good theory for fermions 

93
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:33,801
but that's taking us way beyond this course, this course of material 

94
00:06:34,025 --> 00:06:41,418
We've covered in a sense, a lot about the foundations of quantum mechanics

95
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,709
and very simple quantum mechanical systems 

96
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:47,523
We've covered almost nothing about 

97
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:51,887
what we could call the applications of quantum mechanics 

98
00:06:52,106 --> 00:06:53,875
Not even the applications of quantum mechanics 

99
00:06:54,092 --> 00:06:56,636
but studying quantum mechanical systems 

100
00:06:56,887 --> 00:07:00,092
we didn't even get to the harmonic oscillator that's a disgrace 

101
00:07:01,604 --> 00:07:04,661
but when I finish with quantum mechanics 

102
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,141
next quarter we are gonna to do relativity and field theory 

103
00:07:07,395 --> 00:07:10,279
but then we are going to have to come back to quantum mechanics 

104
00:07:10,547 --> 00:07:16,780
in order to study more about the basic structures 

105
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:18,436
that appear in quantum mechanics

106
00:07:19,821 --> 00:07:24,039
So it's sort of embarrassing to teach a whole course in quantum mechanics 

107
00:07:24,304 --> 00:07:25,905
and never get to the harmonic oscillator 

108
00:07:26,105 --> 00:07:28,612
but that's where we are 

109
00:07:30,774 --> 00:07:34,489
So you can ask your money back I don't know

110
00:07:38,645 --> 00:07:44,467
On the other hand, it does seem people have a lot of fun with entanglement 

111
00:07:44,685 --> 00:07:51,621
I didn't expect such a, a response particularly to this

112
00:07:51,848 --> 00:07:53,901
Some of them are extremely interesting and well done 

113
00:07:54,103 --> 00:07:58,168
Some of the chatter back and forth on the Internet 

114
00:07:58,396 --> 00:08:03,980
I actually did follow it and sometimes it was a generally good 

115
00:08:04,197 --> 00:08:05,837
and sometimes excellent 

116
00:08:06,215 --> 00:08:12,131
so I, got some some sense of satisfaction of teaching that 

117
00:08:15,235 --> 00:08:19,347
We will go on a little bit today about Schrodinger equation 

118
00:08:20,595 --> 00:08:24,451
not the general Schrodinger equation but special Schrodinger equation

119
00:08:24,657 --> 00:08:26,067
That Schrodinger actually wrote down 

120
00:08:27,251 --> 00:08:31,219
The connection with the things we've learned up till now is the wave function 

121
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,801
And the wave function is simply the amplitude that 

122
00:08:37,025 --> 00:08:39,569
the particle is located at a particular position 

123
00:08:39,844 --> 00:08:46,435
in other words it's the inner product of whatever state vector happens to be 

124
00:08:46,653 --> 00:08:48,811
with the state of definite position 

125
00:08:56,652 --> 00:09:00,115
We can also write a momentum space wave function 

126
00:09:00,348 --> 00:09:05,668
The momentum space wave function just the 

127
00:09:05,896 --> 00:09:08,923
projection of the same state whatever it happens to be 

128
00:09:09,203 --> 00:09:13,080
onto a momentum eigenstate, eigenvector 

129
00:09:14,232 --> 00:09:19,180
momentum eigen vectors and the position eigenvectors 

130
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:24,802
Or rather the momentum wave function position wave function are related 

131
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:27,282
and they are related by Fourier transform 

132
00:09:28,386 --> 00:09:32,634
That's the basic structure of position and momentum 

133
00:09:32,862 --> 00:09:37,613
If the particle has more than one direction to move in for example 

134
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,111
let's suppose it can move in the x-y plane

135
00:09:40,323 --> 00:09:46,880
then you characterize the position of a particle by two coordinates

136
00:09:47,111 --> 00:09:51,082
The two coordinates communed 

137
00:09:51,298 --> 00:09:57,276
you can't measure both the X and Y position of a particle simultaneously 

138
00:09:57,571 --> 00:10:03,251
Now is that something that follows automatically from 

139
00:10:03,466 --> 00:10:04,554
what we set up till now?

140
00:10:04,793 --> 00:10:08,155
No, not at all, it's really an empirical fact 

141
00:10:08,429 --> 00:10:13,084
It's an empirical fact that the structure of the quantum mechanics of particles

142
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:21,934
only conforms to, to experiment if we assume that 

143
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,605
the different coordinates with different directions 

144
00:10:27,823 --> 00:10:29,511
the particle can move and commute 

145
00:10:29,737 --> 00:10:34,033
That means the wave function is not really a function not of a single variable 

146
00:10:34,318 --> 00:10:35,890
but a functional collection of variables 

147
00:10:36,121 --> 00:10:39,895
the collection of variables being the position in the 

148
00:10:40,091 --> 00:10:41,527
various coordinates of the particle

149
00:10:41,758 --> 00:10:47,086
If we have several particles then the wave function becomes 

150
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,790
a function of the coordinates of all the particles 

151
00:10:51,087 --> 00:10:52,105
We are not gonna go into that today 

152
00:10:52,105 --> 00:10:58,610
it's the, I just tell you that the wave function thought of 

153
00:10:58,809 --> 00:11:01,470
the wave function of a collection of particles 

154
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:06,401
It is not a function of three-dimensional space 

155
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:11,639
It's a function of all of the coordinates of all of the particles 

156
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:16,909
In the same way the phase space the phase space of a particle 

157
00:11:17,155 --> 00:11:21,682
is described by a collection of a large number of coordinates and momenta 

158
00:11:21,917 --> 00:11:25,405
in the case of classical physics, the wave function of a particle 

159
00:11:25,658 --> 00:11:27,626
is a collection of a system, 

160
00:11:27,847 --> 00:11:33,659
It's a collection of a, the function of the collection of all the coordinates 

161
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,980
So for example if you have 10 to the 23rd particles 

162
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:40,873
Psi would be a function of 10 to the 23rd coordinates 

163
00:11:42,261 --> 00:11:46,133
So that's, that's the basic structure 

164
00:11:46,365 --> 00:11:50,755
and you can go to momentum space by Fourier transform 

165
00:11:50,971 --> 00:11:53,501
and write the wave function instead 

166
00:11:53,716 --> 00:11:57,147
As a wave function of all of the momenta of all particles 

167
00:11:57,363 --> 00:12:01,682
you can even have mixed situations mixed representations 

168
00:12:01,897 --> 00:12:06,831
Where you may describe a wave function in terms of coordinates 

169
00:12:07,047 --> 00:12:10,067
of some of the particles and momenta of the other particles

170
00:12:10,309 --> 00:12:11,758
This is also allowed

171
00:12:11,972 --> 00:12:16,477
But we are gonna focus on the case of one-dimensional motion again 

172
00:12:16,746 --> 00:12:21,884
We will come back to that and just discuss the behavior of the wave function

173
00:12:22,097 --> 00:12:24,286
It's properties, just a little bit 

174
00:12:24,558 --> 00:12:26,932
Mainly properties in Schrodinger equation 

175
00:12:27,142 --> 00:12:30,164
First the uncertainty principle 

176
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,492
Where does the uncertainty principle come from?

177
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:42,684
It comes from the fact that x and coordinate p don't commute 

178
00:12:42,951 --> 00:12:47,412
whenever two coordinates or two observables don't commute 

179
00:12:47,644 --> 00:12:50,804
It becomes impossible to measure both of them simultaneously 

180
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:57,203
because there are in eigenvectors which are eigenvectors of both observables

181
00:12:57,417 --> 00:13:03,655
In particular the eigenvectors of X are extremely different

182
00:13:03,862 --> 00:13:08,790
Every eigenvector of X is extremely different from every eigenvector of p

183
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:15,635
The eigenvectors of X are sharp narrow highly localized functions in space

184
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:20,149
And the eigenvectors of momentum first of all complex 

185
00:13:20,376 --> 00:13:23,922
e to the IPX, but their real and imaginary parts 

186
00:13:24,188 --> 00:13:28,728
are oscillations over all of the space

187
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:31,311
And so it's space filling 

188
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,856
They are not space filling, it's not that the particle fills space 

189
00:13:37,062 --> 00:13:41,714
It's just the particle is every where equally likely to be everywhere

190
00:13:41,938 --> 00:13:43,250
when it's momentum is known

191
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:48,867
So that's the most primitive observation of the uncertainty principle

192
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:50,994
If you know the position of the particle

193
00:13:51,218 --> 00:13:53,258
You certainly don't know it's momentum or 

194
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,415
If a particle is in a position eigenstate

195
00:13:55,415 --> 00:13:58,544
It's very far from momentum eigenstate 

196
00:13:58,786 --> 00:14:01,202
If it is momentum eigenstate, it's very far from a position eigenstate 

197
00:14:03,124 --> 00:14:04,879
That's the most primitive version of it

198
00:14:06,049 --> 00:14:08,123
You can say more qualitatively 

199
00:14:08,345 --> 00:14:10,069
You can say more qualitatively 

200
00:14:10,287 --> 00:14:12,456
And then we will come to quantitative, 

201
00:14:12,692 --> 00:14:15,155
come to quantitative for precise theorem at the moment 

202
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:23,012
But if we look at the wave function as a function of x

203
00:14:23,218 --> 00:14:33,747
And it's relationship by Fourier transform dP over the square root of 2 pi

204
00:14:34,971 --> 00:14:41,669
Psi twiddle of p, e to the ipx

205
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,963
And I won't bother writing the other relationship

206
00:14:46,175 --> 00:14:49,403
The other relationship is the one that writes psi of p in terms of psi of x

207
00:14:52,195 --> 00:14:59,956
And just start fooling around, trying to construct Psi of p or Psi of x

208
00:15:00,207 --> 00:15:03,259
One from the other by Fourier transform 

209
00:15:03,489 --> 00:15:11,509
And you will very quickly discover that the narrower the distribution in x

210
00:15:11,789 --> 00:15:16,201
The boarder the distribution in p will be

211
00:15:16,405 --> 00:15:19,481
That's the property just of the Fourier analysis 

212
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:26,378
That the narrower psi of x is

213
00:15:26,653 --> 00:15:28,946
The boarder psi of p is, and vice versa

214
00:15:30,283 --> 00:15:34,219
That psi of P is very narrow, it means that it just 

215
00:15:34,424 --> 00:15:36,442
It's just basically a single plane wave, 

216
00:15:36,786 --> 00:15:41,557
It is very broad in x, and so that's a pattern of Fourier transform 

217
00:15:41,831 --> 00:15:47,119
The narrower the function is, the broader it's Fourier transform is

218
00:15:47,345 --> 00:15:51,079
That's the qualitative understanding of the uncertainty principle 

219
00:15:51,305 --> 00:15:53,319
But let's try to do it a little bit better 

220
00:15:53,534 --> 00:16:00,656
Let's try to see if we can define the notion of uncertainty

221
00:16:02,073 --> 00:16:05,228
And then to see if we can prove a theorem 

222
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:10,733
I'm gonna prove a slightly simplified version of the theorem 

223
00:16:11,044 --> 00:16:14,651
mostly because there's just too much on the blackboard 

224
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:16,439
if I prove the full general theorem 

225
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:18,567
I will prove a simplified version of it 

226
00:16:18,788 --> 00:16:22,070
But the simplified version of it contains the basic ingredients 

227
00:16:22,303 --> 00:16:28,131
Alright first of all, what is meant by the uncertainty in a variable?

228
00:16:29,424 --> 00:16:32,313
You have some distribution for that variable 

229
00:16:33,497 --> 00:16:39,292
and the first thing to do before discussing the uncertainty in it 

230
00:16:39,528 --> 00:16:48,607
is shift the axes so that the average of x, let's say this is

231
00:16:48,817 --> 00:16:53,470
Let's say this is X, so that the average of X is zero 

232
00:16:53,719 --> 00:16:57,821
you can always do that, if the average of X is not zero 

233
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:00,302
Let's suppose you have some wave function like that

234
00:17:00,528 --> 00:17:02,679
X equals to zero is over here 

235
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:06,216
If you put your center of coordinates over here 

236
00:17:06,418 --> 00:17:10,384
Obviously the average of X the expectation value of X will be negative 

237
00:17:10,591 --> 00:17:18,568
If you put your coordinates over here, the the average of X will clearly be positive

238
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:22,562
and as you move the origin, you will eventually find the position 

239
00:17:22,756 --> 00:17:25,658
where the average of X is exactly equal to zero so

240
00:17:25,898 --> 00:17:32,620
Let's simplify our story by shifting coordinates 

241
00:17:32,864 --> 00:17:34,936
It's just a shift of coordinates, just shifting our coordinates 

242
00:17:35,191 --> 00:17:38,608
until the average value of X is equal to zero

243
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,648
average of X is equal to zero

244
00:17:44,032 --> 00:17:50,011
Then what would, we've done it, the average of x is equal to zero 

245
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:56,551
what is the uncertainty? the uncertainty by definition 

246
00:17:56,766 --> 00:17:59,327
is the average of X square, 

247
00:18:00,495 --> 00:18:05,979
and looking at the average of X, is zero because anything on this side 

248
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,027
is balanced by something on this side 

249
00:18:08,247 --> 00:18:10,971
X is positive over here X is negative over here 

250
00:18:11,231 --> 00:18:15,046
so looking at the average of it the average will cancel 

251
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,304
if you choose your axes in the right place

252
00:18:17,515 --> 00:18:22,762
But the average of X square, X square measured relative to this 

253
00:18:23,033 --> 00:18:26,706
located x here, will not be zero

254
00:18:26,923 --> 00:18:31,510
X squared is nonzero here, x square is nonzero here 

255
00:18:31,728 --> 00:18:35,813
In fact that's the only place where the X square is zero 

256
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:39,325
Just right at the origin, so there is no way that the average of X squared 

257
00:18:39,546 --> 00:18:41,828
can be, can be zero 

258
00:18:43,064 --> 00:18:46,133
in fact the broader the wave function, 

259
00:18:46,346 --> 00:18:50,194
the larger the expectation value of X squared will be 

260
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:59,949
That's clear, so a good measure, a good measure of the width of the distribution

261
00:19:00,187 --> 00:19:02,781
You can call the uncertainty of x, 

262
00:19:03,033 --> 00:19:05,214
and that is the definition really of the uncertainty of an x

263
00:19:05,424 --> 00:19:08,906
It's the average of X squared 

264
00:19:13,805 --> 00:19:19,102
the average value of X squared with a given probability distribution 

265
00:19:19,311 --> 00:19:23,596
Given that the average of x itself is equal to zero 

266
00:19:23,824 --> 00:19:28,383
That is the uncertainty of X, 

267
00:19:43,761 --> 00:19:44,770
And that's just called a positive number, delta X squared

268
00:19:45,005 --> 00:19:50,595
and the broader the distribution the larger it will be 

269
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:55,444
How do you calculate it if you know the wave function?

270
00:19:55,747 --> 00:20:02,407
Very simply you take the integral of Psi star psi of x

271
00:20:02,605 --> 00:20:08,055
That's the probability to find the particle at X, times X squared 

272
00:20:08,253 --> 00:20:12,475
that's the expectation value of X squared 

273
00:20:12,659 --> 00:20:14,931
That is the average of X squared

274
00:20:15,128 --> 00:20:18,912
The probability to find the particle at position X times X squared 

275
00:20:19,137 --> 00:20:24,036
that's the definition of the square of the uncertainty 

276
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:26,506
that's the square of the uncertainty of X 

277
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:30,176
What does it say? It's the definition but it's a good definition

278
00:20:37,616 --> 00:20:40,206
Let me rewrite it up here,

279
00:20:41,729 --> 00:20:46,713
Delta x and I will square it, is equal to the integral of psi star psi

280
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:55,248
Times X squared dx, alright now what about the uncertainty in momentum? 

281
00:20:55,424 --> 00:20:59,187
the uncertainty in momentum is defined in a very similar way 

282
00:21:01,941 --> 00:21:12,835
Oh, one other point, and this is equal to psi X squared psi

283
00:21:14,245 --> 00:21:19,659
It's the expectation value in the state psi of x x squared, 

284
00:21:21,829 --> 00:21:24,038
Thought of as a quantum mechanical

285
00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:25,703
This is the quantum mechanical formula, 

286
00:21:25,893 --> 00:21:30,379
the expectation value of X squared that's the uncertainty 

287
00:21:30,618 --> 00:21:33,260
What about the uncertainty in momentum? 

288
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:36,652
In fact for that matter what about the uncertainty in anything? 

289
00:21:36,882 --> 00:21:41,781
The uncertainty in anything assuming it's average is equal to zero 

290
00:21:41,984 --> 00:21:46,126
is just the average of the square of that quantity 

291
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:47,550
that's the general definition 

292
00:21:47,741 --> 00:21:53,507
Incidentally if you are if you don't want to shift the coordinates 

293
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,659
so that the average is equal to zero 

294
00:21:55,846 --> 00:22:02,013
you can use another definition, and the other definition is that 

295
00:22:02,853 --> 00:22:07,146
It's the expectation value of X squared minus 

296
00:22:07,346 --> 00:22:11,869
the expectation value of x, squared

297
00:22:12,072 --> 00:22:16,447
So two different things, the expectation value of the square of something 

298
00:22:16,652 --> 00:22:19,394
is not the square of the expectation values

299
00:22:19,602 --> 00:22:24,482
In particular, if the expectation value of X is equal to zero 

300
00:22:24,723 --> 00:22:28,004
it does not follow the expectation of x square is equal to zero 

301
00:22:28,236 --> 00:22:36,267
This is a more general definition of the square of the uncertainty in x

302
00:22:36,475 --> 00:22:41,878
But as I said you can always shift your axes around 

303
00:22:42,068 --> 00:22:46,734
so that this is equal to zero, I just choose this one here 

304
00:22:46,928 --> 00:22:52,028
okay what about the expectation what about the uncertainty of momentum?

305
00:22:52,236 --> 00:22:55,869
The uncertainty of momentum is defined in essentially the same way 

306
00:23:01,999 --> 00:23:06,775
You can define it if you like using the Fourier transform the wave function 

307
00:23:06,973 --> 00:23:09,592
and then it would just be, I'm not going to use this definition 

308
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:17,302
but let's just do it, delta p squared would be the integral psi twiddle of p

309
00:23:18,526 --> 00:23:23,385
psi of p times P squared dP 

310
00:23:23,588 --> 00:23:27,417
This would be the probability that the particle has momentum P 

311
00:23:27,681 --> 00:23:29,993
times P squared integrate over p,

312
00:23:30,188 --> 00:23:33,614
but I'm not going to do it this way 

313
00:23:33,815 --> 00:23:36,879
What I'm gonna do is just observe this quantity over here 

314
00:23:37,074 --> 00:23:46,429
has nothing but, psi p square psi 

315
00:23:47,829 --> 00:23:51,550
And now I'm going to work in the position representation 

316
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,958
We can do that because we know what the operator p is

317
00:23:55,145 --> 00:23:59,194
when it acts on a wave function psi of x,

318
00:23:59,405 --> 00:24:04,135
what is P do? what does the operator P do 

319
00:24:04,323 --> 00:24:09,941
when it acts on a wave function in the, in the X basis 

320
00:24:11,063 --> 00:24:15,816
what it does, well first of all whenever you take expectation values 

321
00:24:16,048 --> 00:24:19,596
or inner products, you will have a integral of dx to do 

322
00:24:22,408 --> 00:24:24,922
From the bra vector here you would have psi star of x

323
00:24:25,111 --> 00:24:31,767
The ket side of this is P squared time psi

324
00:24:31,956 --> 00:24:35,970
What is p squared? P is minus i d by dx

325
00:24:37,204 --> 00:24:38,732
I'm using that now, 

326
00:24:42,416 --> 00:24:47,716
momentum operator p is minus i d by dx

327
00:24:47,947 --> 00:24:54,781
And p square is just minus d second d by dX square, second derivative 

328
00:24:55,023 --> 00:24:56,253
that's what a p square is,

329
00:24:56,439 --> 00:24:58,448
twice with P once and then twice,

330
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:14,828
So, this is equal to the integral dx psi star of X, d second psi by d x squared 

331
00:25:15,086 --> 00:25:24,137
with a minus sign, the minus sign coming from minus i times minus i

332
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,604
Hey, look at this and you worry a little bit 

333
00:25:29,222 --> 00:25:35,165
There is a minus sign here, how can the uncertainty in P be negative?

334
00:25:35,393 --> 00:25:39,410
What does it mean to have a negative uncertainty of P?

335
00:25:40,944 --> 00:25:45,187
There is a minus sign here, what's going on? 

336
00:25:45,415 --> 00:25:49,994
What's going on is that the integral here is negative 

337
00:25:50,189 --> 00:25:51,970
That's all that is going on

338
00:25:52,167 --> 00:25:54,434
How do you see that the integrals are negative?

339
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:59,055
You integrate by parts, so I will just remind you the rule for integrating by parts

340
00:25:59,275 --> 00:26:02,279
is if you have, I'm gonna use this over and over 

341
00:26:03,448 --> 00:26:05,952
Two functions F and G 

342
00:26:06,141 --> 00:26:13,037
Then the integral F dG by dx is equal to 

343
00:26:13,037 --> 00:26:18,887
minus the integral dF by dx, time G dx

344
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:26,487
This is true as long as F and G go to zero appropriately at infinity 

345
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:32,099
So that the boundary terms don't contribute to the integration by parts

346
00:26:33,243 --> 00:26:36,607
Just look at the structure of it, I will use it over and over 

347
00:26:37,889 --> 00:26:40,838
You can switch the derivative from one factor to the other factor 

348
00:26:41,124 --> 00:26:45,500
at the cost of a minus sign, that's the, that's the basic rule

349
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:49,896
Okay so let's, this is a second derivative 

350
00:26:50,857 --> 00:26:54,453
Second derivative is also of course a first derivative 

351
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:56,991
Namely it's the first derivative of the first derivative 

352
00:26:58,855 --> 00:27:00,279
d psi by dx 

353
00:27:03,297 --> 00:27:06,802
Let's do a integration by parts,

354
00:27:06,976 --> 00:27:13,250
All we have to do is switch the d by dx to psi star and change the minus sign

355
00:27:13,493 --> 00:27:19,135
Okay? So this becomes d X, put the dx over here,

356
00:27:20,368 --> 00:27:26,873
the d by dx can switch to the psi star at the cost of a change of sign 

357
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:33,493
So this becomes plus and this becomes d psi star by dx

358
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:39,067
Now look what we have here, we have d psi by d X 

359
00:27:39,285 --> 00:27:40,949
And we have d psi star by dx

360
00:27:41,143 --> 00:27:45,135
This factor is the complex conjugate of this factor 

361
00:27:45,309 --> 00:27:47,352
It is just complex conjugate of each other 

362
00:27:47,572 --> 00:27:51,278
and what happens if you multiply a complex conjugate of a function 

363
00:27:51,457 --> 00:27:52,644
by it's complex conjugate?

364
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:56,357
First of all it's real, and second of all it's positive 

365
00:27:56,556 --> 00:28:01,131
So the integrand here is positive, the sign got changed

366
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:05,064
to plus, and this is most definitely a positive integral here 

367
00:28:05,321 --> 00:28:09,577
so P squared, this is the expectation value of P squared 

368
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:16,177
>>Do we know that the average of P is zero?

369
00:28:20,726 --> 00:28:23,430
We can always shift P until it's zero 

370
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,958
Now the real question is 

371
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:28,281
Can you have both the average of X and the average of P equal to zero? 

372
00:28:28,487 --> 00:28:31,265
That's not so obvious, the answer is yes 

373
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:38,357
You can always, you can always shift for us to shift X equal to zero 

374
00:28:38,574 --> 00:28:40,110
and then you can shift the p equal to zero 

375
00:28:41,393 --> 00:28:44,049
There is a trick, you know I think of coming but 

376
00:28:44,261 --> 00:28:47,557
let's come back to it, ask me again, I don't want to get off the track 

377
00:28:47,749 --> 00:28:56,290
The answer is yes, you can take a wave function and shift it both in x and p

378
00:28:56,463 --> 00:28:58,801
Until both of them have average equal to zero 

379
00:28:58,993 --> 00:29:00,730
We will come back to it, I will explain to you why in a little while

380
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,497
But let's suppose we've done that

381
00:29:04,569 --> 00:29:13,851
And let's see if we can find a relationship between the uncertainty in x

382
00:29:14,061 --> 00:29:16,842
and the uncertainty, they are none in relationship

383
00:29:17,111 --> 00:29:20,271
But it is supposed to call as a relationship in mathematics 

384
00:29:20,478 --> 00:29:23,889
but a inequality is what I want, an inequality, 

385
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:26,377
the inequality should be such that

386
00:29:26,377 --> 00:29:29,095
When delta x is small, delta p is big

387
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:31,845
delta p is small, delta x is big, or better yet

388
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:36,877
the product of delta X times Delta P cannot be smaller than what

389
00:29:37,063 --> 00:29:41,674
Than h bar, now I've lost h bar in here 

390
00:29:41,884 --> 00:29:45,443
Because I set it equal to one

391
00:29:45,657 --> 00:29:47,996
We would put it back later, but if you want to put it in here 

392
00:29:48,193 --> 00:29:53,040
Now we should probably put it in here as one of the h bar squared here 

393
00:29:53,254 --> 00:29:56,372
The H bar squared here, and the H bar squared here 

394
00:29:56,585 --> 00:29:59,870
but let's not, do I have the right place? yes I do 

395
00:30:01,135 --> 00:30:03,632
But let's work with h bar equal to one and later on 

396
00:30:03,876 --> 00:30:06,859
when we are finish I will put back the dimensional quantities 

397
00:30:07,059 --> 00:30:08,732
Okay so here we are, 

398
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:17,227
What tools that we have to construct inequalities?

399
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:21,352
It's basically one of the zillion inequalities in mathematics 

400
00:30:21,548 --> 00:30:24,874
but probably the most famous and most useful 

401
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:29,209
and the only one I know it's a particular useful is the triangle inequality 

402
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:32,969
Everybody know the triangle inequality?

403
00:30:34,546 --> 00:30:36,147
Some people do, some people don't 

404
00:30:36,347 --> 00:30:40,430
So I will tell it to you, and it comes in two forms 

405
00:30:41,654 --> 00:30:44,370
It's a statement about triangles of all things

406
00:30:44,575 --> 00:30:48,317
What it says is if you have a triangle 

407
00:30:48,317 --> 00:30:52,623
that the sum of any two sides is bigger than the third side, 

408
00:30:52,832 --> 00:30:56,548
Obviously true right? The sum of this side and this side, 

409
00:30:56,801 --> 00:30:57,878
Why is that? 

410
00:30:58,054 --> 00:31:01,192
Because the shortest distance between any two points is the straight line

411
00:31:01,435 --> 00:31:04,754
So the shortest distance between these two points is this one 

412
00:31:04,951 --> 00:31:08,661
Any other two sides or sum of the two sides is certainly bigger 

413
00:31:08,879 --> 00:31:16,936
So if we have three sides, there is also another version of it 

414
00:31:18,026 --> 00:31:21,307
Tell you what I think I'll prove the other version, 

415
00:31:21,307 --> 00:31:22,703
but you know the other version pretty well

416
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:27,207
Also let's call this one A, let's call this one B, let's call this one C 

417
00:31:28,438 --> 00:31:41,029
Okay so A+ B is bigger than C, 

418
00:31:42,742 --> 00:31:49,213
or A+B is bigger than C

419
00:31:52,146 --> 00:31:56,341
|A|+|B| is also by the same argument it is the same thing 

420
00:31:56,581 --> 00:32:02,971
is bigger than |A+B|, if these are vectors, think of these as vectors 

421
00:32:03,189 --> 00:32:07,821
Here's a vector A, here's a vector B

422
00:32:15,029 --> 00:32:18,678
C is not A+B , it's A minus B in this case

423
00:32:19,682 --> 00:32:26,268
I think I want it this way, A B C 

424
00:32:26,557 --> 00:32:33,433
Okay still a triangle, A+B is bigger than C which is the same as saying

425
00:32:33,615 --> 00:32:39,848
It's bigger than A+B, let's square it, let's square it

426
00:32:40,019 --> 00:32:44,461
and this becomes A square, square the side of A, plus B square,

427
00:32:47,439 --> 00:32:57,695
plus twice |A|, |B| is bigger than this guy over here

428
00:32:57,951 --> 00:33:01,087
What's the square of A plus B?

429
00:33:01,296 --> 00:33:14,995
It is A squared plus B squared plus twice the dot product of A B

430
00:33:16,468 --> 00:33:18,509
where did they get that from? 

431
00:33:18,717 --> 00:33:28,741
I wrote that A+B squared is just A+B dot A+B 

432
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:35,511
That's the square of the length of a vector and 

433
00:33:35,702 --> 00:33:41,842
that's A squared plus B squared, plus twice the dot product of A and B 

434
00:33:43,126 --> 00:33:46,534
and so we have now an inequality from which 

435
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:50,183
we can erase A square and B square from both sides

436
00:33:54,686 --> 00:33:57,430
Here's another form of triangle inequality

437
00:33:59,422 --> 00:34:07,650
Let's erase the two-s, what it says is if you have any two vectors 

438
00:34:08,632 --> 00:34:12,784
Given any two vectors, here's one vector, here's another one A B 

439
00:34:14,024 --> 00:34:21,674
That the product of the set, 

440
00:34:21,853 --> 00:34:24,058
the length of one of them times the length of the other 

441
00:34:24,264 --> 00:34:27,314
is always bigger than, these two disappears

442
00:34:27,521 --> 00:34:29,632
It is bigger than the dot product 

443
00:34:32,579 --> 00:34:34,277
There is another way to think about that 

444
00:34:37,025 --> 00:34:41,492
What was the dot product in terms of length of A and length of B 

445
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:42,622
and something else

446
00:34:42,835 --> 00:34:44,653
What else do I need to know to calculate the dot product?

447
00:34:44,838 --> 00:34:49,702
Cosine of the angle, so A dot B is of course nothing but 

448
00:34:50,926 --> 00:34:55,437
A B cosine of the angle 

449
00:34:55,673 --> 00:34:58,239
Cosine of an angle is always less than one 

450
00:34:59,511 --> 00:35:03,507
So the triangle inequality is pretty trivial, 

451
00:35:03,708 --> 00:35:09,263
It simply says that the magnitude product of the magnitude of two vectors 

452
00:35:09,477 --> 00:35:12,382
is always bigger than the dot product between them 

453
00:35:12,586 --> 00:35:15,690
because the dot product always has a cosine 

454
00:35:15,858 --> 00:35:19,610
Now this is true for vectors in two dimensions, three dimensions

455
00:35:19,898 --> 00:35:25,595
100 zillion dimensions, it is even true for vectors in complex vector spaces 

456
00:35:26,024 --> 00:35:31,406
It's just generally true for vectors in any kind of vector space 

457
00:35:31,649 --> 00:35:38,722
that magnitude defined as the square root of the inner product 

458
00:35:38,883 --> 00:35:42,821
of the vector with itself, that this inequality is true in fact 

459
00:35:44,077 --> 00:35:51,877
Let's write this a copy, and let's square it because 

460
00:35:52,145 --> 00:35:56,257
We are gonna use the square form, A square, B squared is greater than 

461
00:35:56,508 --> 00:36:05,483
A dot B square, I just squared the, I might have done anything .. 

462
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:08,667
That's the inequality that we are gonna use

463
00:36:14,582 --> 00:36:17,387
Yes it should be greater than or equal to, the only time it is equal 

464
00:36:17,613 --> 00:36:20,428
is when A and B are on the same direction 

465
00:36:20,662 --> 00:36:23,691
That's right, greater than or equal to 

466
00:36:25,147 --> 00:36:28,078
Cosine theta is equal to, it's equal to one

467
00:36:29,467 --> 00:36:35,948
That's going to be our, other trick, so I don't think I need this anymore 

468
00:36:36,179 --> 00:36:38,896
We will come back to it, yeah we will

469
00:37:08,117 --> 00:37:12,875
In a look it looks promising we have a Delta X squared here 

470
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:17,954
Sort of like A squared, we have a Delta P squared here sort of like B squared 

471
00:37:18,154 --> 00:37:20,834
And we want to show that it's bigger than something 

472
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:29,763
So the trick is to define the right A-s and B-s in terms of psi and x and so forth

473
00:37:30,109 --> 00:37:31,683
and then just use the theorem, 

474
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:34,381
but I'm going to make one simplifying assumption 

475
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:36,845
I've already made two simplifying assumptions 

476
00:37:37,023 --> 00:37:40,084
that the expectation value of X and P are zero 

477
00:37:40,294 --> 00:37:43,020
that I will show you how to arrange 

478
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:45,380
And that is, there is no trickery here, 

479
00:37:45,577 --> 00:37:49,205
The simplifying assumption I'm going to make only because 

480
00:37:49,405 --> 00:37:52,537
I don't want to fill up the blackboard with more algebra than I need 

481
00:37:52,742 --> 00:37:56,621
Than necessary, this is something you can sit down with 

482
00:37:56,825 --> 00:37:59,643
And go through it for the more general case 

483
00:37:59,849 --> 00:38:04,059
I'm going to assume that the wave function psi of X is real 

484
00:38:04,277 --> 00:38:09,731
if I didn't, we'd be chasing around psi-s and psi stars and 

485
00:38:09,975 --> 00:38:13,899
I would eventually tire you out and you would probably 

486
00:38:14,117 --> 00:38:16,171
lose the thread of the argument 

487
00:38:16,389 --> 00:38:18,853
so I'm going to assume that psi is real 

488
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:23,325
It will save us some algebra it's not general 

489
00:38:23,571 --> 00:38:27,268
but it's very easy to fill in the steps for complex psi

490
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:29,477
Easy but it takes a few more lines 

491
00:38:29,716 --> 00:38:34,831
and I just I just after sitting down and doing it on a piece of paper 

492
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,830
I just decided it was too much for a blackboard presentations to do 

493
00:38:39,027 --> 00:38:42,167
that if you do it for the simple case, so psi is real 

494
00:38:43,642 --> 00:38:47,065
Okay so here we are, we can get rid of the psi stars

495
00:38:51,556 --> 00:38:53,780
and I think I lost in the equation here 

496
00:38:54,996 --> 00:39:01,006
Using the fact that P is minus i d by dx, we proved that 

497
00:39:01,235 --> 00:39:08,370
this is equal to integral d psi star by dx, d psi by dx,

498
00:39:09,554 --> 00:39:12,729
We should mind you, just quickly remind you how we did it 

499
00:39:12,956 --> 00:39:17,126
P squared was a second derivative, well minus second derivative 

500
00:39:17,341 --> 00:39:18,823
And then we do integration by parts 

501
00:39:19,057 --> 00:39:22,419
Take one of the derivatives and put it over here

502
00:39:24,479 --> 00:39:27,462
What we are trying to prove is the product of this times this 

503
00:39:27,686 --> 00:39:32,462
is bigger than something, product of this times this is bigger than something

504
00:39:33,592 --> 00:39:39,345
okay and to do so, is just, think of A and B as vectors, 

505
00:39:39,608 --> 00:39:43,068
in fact you can think of A and B as either bra vectors and ket vectors

506
00:39:43,293 --> 00:39:47,529
Since psi is real, it doesn't matter whether they are bra vectors or ket vectors

507
00:39:47,529 --> 00:39:51,193
But here is what it gonna be, one vector A,

508
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:56,506
I'm writing them now in vector in the bra-ket notation

509
00:39:56,731 --> 00:40:00,566
The triangle inequality is perfectly true for bras kets 

510
00:40:00,771 --> 00:40:02,706
as well as for ordinary vectors

511
00:40:03,843 --> 00:40:07,827
Alright so the vector A is going to be describe 

512
00:40:08,016 --> 00:40:15,248
It is going to be the vector whose wave function is not psi of x, but x psi of x

513
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:21,117
A is the vector whose wave function is x psi,

514
00:40:21,353 --> 00:40:24,824
That's another words it's x, operating on psi

515
00:40:25,038 --> 00:40:37,145
And B is going to be the vector P times Psi, or basically minus i 

516
00:40:37,833 --> 00:40:46,278
d psi by d x, when I write equals here I mean to say that 

517
00:40:46,594 --> 00:40:49,440
A is a vector whose wave function x psi of x, 

518
00:40:49,756 --> 00:40:52,900
B is a vector whose wave function i d psi by dx 

519
00:40:53,213 --> 00:40:55,689
We are gonna apply the triangle inequality to that

520
00:40:57,316 --> 00:41:07,608
Okay, notice that with this definition here delta x squared 

521
00:41:08,171 --> 00:41:14,222
is a squared, look at it, the inner product of A with itself 

522
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:21,548
A squared is just the integral of psi star psi times x square 

523
00:41:21,833 --> 00:41:31,376
So this is here A square, with this notation 

524
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:37,753
What about this one? This one here is essentially

525
00:41:44,358 --> 00:41:50,151
B squared, inner product of B with itself 

526
00:41:50,527 --> 00:41:57,449
How come I don't have a, I have a minus i d by dx here 

527
00:41:57,766 --> 00:42:03,764
If I put minus i d by dx over here, I have a minus sign times minus sign

528
00:42:04,107 --> 00:42:06,259
which is minus one, How come I don't get, 

529
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,360
how come I have a plus one and minus one?

530
00:42:08,673 --> 00:42:12,845
Complex conjugation, so this is B squared, that's A squared 

531
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:19,871
And A square times B squared is this, it is also delta x squared 

532
00:42:20,267 --> 00:42:25,005
times delta p squared, so delta x squared, delta p squared 

533
00:42:25,264 --> 00:42:31,433
A squared B squared, the triangle inequality is literally talking about 

534
00:42:31,766 --> 00:42:33,653
delta x squared, delta p squared 

535
00:42:33,908 --> 00:42:36,861
So now let's look at the other side of the inequality here 

536
00:42:37,152 --> 00:42:41,895
The other side of the inequality is A dot B square

537
00:42:42,256 --> 00:42:47,219
So let's compute A dot B, it's the inner product of these two vectors 

538
00:42:47,555 --> 00:42:51,326
and then we squared it, we take the absolute value and square it 

539
00:42:51,712 --> 00:42:55,879
Because we take the absolute value I don't have to keep track of i-s minus i-s

540
00:42:56,187 --> 00:43:00,333
In the end they will all go away, because they take the absolute value 

541
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:04,345
And so the inner product of A dot B is going to be equal

542
00:43:04,693 --> 00:43:09,073
It is going to have an integral, oh, one thing

543
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:12,534
I did say that I'm going to choose psi to be real 

544
00:43:12,975 --> 00:43:16,100
So all of these psi stars don't matter they just psi

545
00:43:16,461 --> 00:43:19,595
Everyplace there is a psi star, you can think of it as psi

546
00:43:19,947 --> 00:43:28,498
Okay so let's take A dot B squared that's going to be A which is psi of x, x

547
00:43:28,789 --> 00:43:31,622
x is written as this in the opposite order

548
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,928
And then times B which is going to d psi by dx

549
00:43:38,784 --> 00:43:42,855
As I said I'm not worried about psi-s or i-s

550
00:43:43,178 --> 00:43:47,561
For the simple reason that in the end I'm going to take the absolute value 

551
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:51,415
So that doesn't play any, that will play no role 

552
00:43:53,275 --> 00:43:58,728
And let's look at this quantity, now we have A dot B squared 

553
00:43:59,046 --> 00:44:02,681
So I can multiply this by itself, if I want to multiply it by itself 

554
00:44:03,011 --> 00:44:06,623
I can multiply it by another integral of the same type 

555
00:44:06,942 --> 00:44:14,874
y d psi by dy, this is d x, this is dy,

556
00:44:15,189 --> 00:44:17,576
What I'm doing is writing the same thing twice 

557
00:44:17,882 --> 00:44:23,598
So if I can evaluate this I'm also evaluating this 

558
00:44:23,934 --> 00:44:34,174
Okay so here's the trick, the trick is to say d psi by dx times psi

559
00:44:34,482 --> 00:44:37,483
Does that ring a bell to you? d psi by dx time psi?

560
00:44:37,786 --> 00:44:40,618
>>

561
00:44:40,931 --> 00:44:43,589
No no no, not the derivative law, in the derivative law 

562
00:44:43,922 --> 00:44:47,602
It was in the denominator, you are on the right track though 

563
00:44:47,913 --> 00:44:51,763
It's the derivative of the square of psi, 

564
00:44:52,059 --> 00:44:55,180
It's one half the derivative of the square of psi

565
00:44:55,478 --> 00:45:04,773
Derivative of the square of psi is equal to twice psi d psi by dx

566
00:45:06,814 --> 00:45:09,884
So apart from the fact that there are a two 

567
00:45:12,795 --> 00:45:20,926
What we have here is x times the derivative of psi squared with respect to x 

568
00:45:21,254 --> 00:45:23,327
Everybody see that? You are allow to if you don't

569
00:45:23,715 --> 00:45:28,820
Okay, I can remove this psi here and replace this by psi square

570
00:45:29,209 --> 00:45:34,280
And at the same time put a factor of two, one half,

571
00:45:36,374 --> 00:45:39,111
That give the same thing with the other factor 

572
00:45:41,124 --> 00:45:49,959
Same thing here, psi squared, by another factor of two 

573
00:45:50,314 --> 00:45:52,154
which makes all together a factor of a quarter

574
00:45:53,756 --> 00:45:59,033
And as I said this is, I don't know why I'm doing it

575
00:45:59,281 --> 00:46:01,283
but these are just y square, 

576
00:46:01,683 --> 00:46:04,372
but it's a square by writing the same thing down again 

577
00:46:04,804 --> 00:46:14,647
Okay next, integration by parts, you have a derivative here 

578
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:17,234
It's a derivative of psi square, but still just a derivative 

579
00:46:17,531 --> 00:46:23,734
and when you have a function times a derivative to be integrated 

580
00:46:24,027 --> 00:46:27,557
you can switch the derivative to the other function 

581
00:46:27,925 --> 00:46:32,381
At the cost of a sign, but really it has no cost of the sign 

582
00:46:32,709 --> 00:46:34,776
Because this is another sign from this one over here 

583
00:46:35,081 --> 00:46:43,667
So there is no real cost in sign, besides we're taking the absolute value 

584
00:46:43,667 --> 00:46:49,466
So this is equal to integral of psi squared 

585
00:46:49,847 --> 00:46:59,894
times d x by dx, and likewise overhere integral psi squared dy by dy 

586
00:47:01,801 --> 00:47:05,590
dx by dx, that's familiar, that is just one 

587
00:47:13,233 --> 00:47:14,860
And this is just squaring the same thing again 

588
00:47:17,695 --> 00:47:23,964
We are finished, we are finished because what is this integral of one quarter?

589
00:47:24,277 --> 00:47:27,108
Forget the quarter, what's the integral of psi squared?

590
00:47:27,412 --> 00:47:29,501
Psi square is psi star psi, if psi is real

591
00:47:29,863 --> 00:47:32,528
Psi star psi is the same as psi square

592
00:47:32,857 --> 00:47:35,578
What's the integral of psi squared? one 

593
00:47:35,969 --> 00:47:39,870
It is the integral of the probability of all space 

594
00:47:40,173 --> 00:47:45,937
So each of these integrals is one if the wave function is normalized 

595
00:47:46,307 --> 00:47:48,872
We assume that the wave function is normalized 

596
00:47:49,301 --> 00:47:51,319
We assume the state vector is normalized 

597
00:47:51,598 --> 00:47:53,847
This whole thing is just one quarter 

598
00:47:54,136 --> 00:48:00,933
And we have proved now the uncertainty principle from the triangle inequality

599
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:12,674
That delta x squared times delta p squared is bigger than one quarter

600
00:48:17,156 --> 00:48:21,268
One quarter I remind you came from two factors like this 

601
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:26,025
Or if we wish to just we can just write this is

602
00:48:26,356 --> 00:48:28,389
We just take the square root of both sides 

603
00:48:28,687 --> 00:48:32,995
Delta x, delta p is bigger than one half, 

604
00:48:37,273 --> 00:48:39,571
Now what about units? 

605
00:48:39,936 --> 00:48:44,016
x and p are not inverse to each other 

606
00:48:44,307 --> 00:48:48,361
so the product of an x and the p can't be a pure number 

607
00:48:48,643 --> 00:48:53,397
What is inverse to an x is a p over h bar,

608
00:48:55,281 --> 00:49:02,627
So really this is delta p over h bar if I put back the units 

609
00:49:02,963 --> 00:49:06,581
Or basically delta x delta p is bigger than a half h bar 

610
00:49:10,292 --> 00:49:18,360
That's, this is the theorem that asserts the uncertainty principle

611
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:24,639
That's the uncertainty in position times the uncertainty momentum 

612
00:49:24,954 --> 00:49:26,745
is bigger than h bar 

613
00:49:27,077 --> 00:49:29,826
Now this would be true for any direction in space

614
00:49:30,138 --> 00:49:37,181
Pick any direction in space, take or any particle any coordinate 

615
00:49:37,512 --> 00:49:39,869
Any generalized coordinate in mechanics 

616
00:49:40,169 --> 00:49:43,815
It's uncertainty times the uncertainty and 

617
00:49:44,114 --> 00:49:47,163
the corresponding conjugate momentum is bigger than h bar 

618
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:52,328
So that's a bigger than h bar or over two as a matter of fact

619
00:49:52,618 --> 00:49:56,419
Any questions about the uncertain about this particular version

620
00:49:56,714 --> 00:49:57,865
of the uncertainty principal?

621
00:49:58,153 --> 00:50:00,009
>>Yeah, another term, 

622
00:50:00,285 --> 00:50:02,643
>> zero, right? 

623
00:50:05,681 --> 00:50:11,486
>>after it times a variable B, it's integral of F time G minus derivative

624
00:50:11,768 --> 00:50:14,674
>>the opposite derivative

625
00:50:24,311 --> 00:50:27,696
Let's call it F prime G plus G prime F

626
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:35,395
Now if you integrate this equation right this

627
00:50:35,701 --> 00:50:40,912
If you integrate this equation, this is the integral of F times G

628
00:50:41,202 --> 00:50:49,106
Plus the integral of G times F is equal to the integral d by dx F G

629
00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:54,753
But the integral of a derivative is just the difference between 

630
00:50:55,192 --> 00:50:57,994
the integrand at the two end point of integration 

631
00:50:58,411 --> 00:51:07,903
So this is FG between the two end points infinity and minus infinity

632
00:51:08,446 --> 00:51:11,981
The symbol stands for FG evaluated at infinity minus 

633
00:51:12,264 --> 00:51:14,393
FG evaluated in the other end of integration 

634
00:51:14,715 --> 00:51:21,938
And what I am assuming is that psi goes to zero at infinity 

635
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:24,995
which would have to do if it is normalized 

636
00:51:25,302 --> 00:51:28,938
If it is a integral as finite, the probability distributions is normalized 

637
00:51:29,237 --> 00:51:34,051
It means that the wave function has to go to zero, so this is zero 

638
00:51:35,844 --> 00:51:38,918
So this is just a rule that you can interchange 

639
00:51:39,257 --> 00:51:41,884
where you put the derivative at the cost of a sign 

640
00:51:47,577 --> 00:51:50,645
Okay, any other question about the uncertainty principle? 

641
00:51:53,223 --> 00:51:58,979
>> and see I don't know if some small point in the

642
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:03,999
No it's not small point, 

643
00:52:04,265 --> 00:52:08,629
when you prove that something is bigger than something else 

644
00:52:08,964 --> 00:52:12,643
You can then ask a question can it ever be equal to that something else?

645
00:52:13,002 --> 00:52:15,102
The answer may or may not 

646
00:52:15,392 --> 00:52:17,427
You know, you may have prove the inequality 

647
00:52:17,721 --> 00:52:19,991
which was not the tightest inequality we could have proved

648
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:28,036
Could have been somebody come along smarter and proved

649
00:52:28,332 --> 00:52:33,002
A tighter inequality that's got a be bigger than something else

650
00:52:33,289 --> 00:52:36,195
A stronger inequality, in this case it is not true 

651
00:52:36,517 --> 00:52:41,976
You can't find wave functions for which delta x delta p is equal to h bar over two

652
00:52:42,312 --> 00:52:45,318
So that co-minimal uncertainty wave packs

653
00:52:45,627 --> 00:52:48,397
So it's really, it's not a nontrivial one

654
00:52:48,681 --> 00:52:52,040
>> It doesn't apply to time and energy?

655
00:52:52,040 --> 00:53:01,028
Well yes, it does, but the circumstances under which you use it 

656
00:53:01,388 --> 00:53:04,453
are less clear and I don't really have time to explain now, 

657
00:53:04,804 --> 00:53:08,539
at some point in these courses we will probably want to think about it 

658
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:13,570
but do remember that the time dependence of wave function 

659
00:53:13,888 --> 00:53:17,705
The time dependence of a wave function psi of t is a function of time 

660
00:53:19,432 --> 00:53:23,502
It is a sum over the eigenvectors of the energy,

661
00:53:23,796 --> 00:53:37,258
Let's call it sum over all the energy eigenvectors of e to the minus i Et

662
00:53:37,604 --> 00:53:45,129
That's time, times the energy eigenvector times a, times a function let's call it

663
00:53:45,442 --> 00:53:48,056
Let's call it Phi of E,

664
00:53:48,395 --> 00:53:52,758
So the relationship between the wave function as a function of time 

665
00:53:52,758 --> 00:53:56,750
and the wave function as a function of energy is once again 

666
00:53:57,257 --> 00:54:00,751
you sum up things, energy with phases like this 

667
00:54:01,092 --> 00:54:04,695
to get things as a function of time, that's the Fourier transform relationship 

668
00:54:05,013 --> 00:54:12,485
So it's, but exactly how you use it is, I'll give you an example of how you use it 

669
00:54:12,796 --> 00:54:15,511
If you have some wave function moving past you

670
00:54:16,070 --> 00:54:20,435
Moving past you and you ask how long does it take 

671
00:54:20,711 --> 00:54:23,895
for the wave function to actually pass you 

672
00:54:24,233 --> 00:54:26,808
and this could be a light beam incidentally

673
00:54:27,053 --> 00:54:30,632
but how long does it take for the wave function to move past you?

674
00:54:32,437 --> 00:54:37,346
Another words what's the uncertainty in the time in which the wave function 

675
00:54:37,637 --> 00:54:40,335
might have maximum, maximum, 

676
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:43,670
how long does it take the maximum to get past you

677
00:54:44,525 --> 00:54:47,227
that you can call delta t uncertainty in time 

678
00:54:47,552 --> 00:54:50,122
that the wave function arrived right at your nose 

679
00:54:50,419 --> 00:54:54,190
It's related to the uncertainty in the energy of the wave function 

680
00:54:54,548 --> 00:55:00,112
the bigger the uncertainty in the energy, well, let's say it in the other way

681
00:55:00,449 --> 00:55:02,667
The smaller the uncertainty in the energy, 

682
00:55:02,977 --> 00:55:07,846
the bigger the uncertainty in when that wave packet will pass you for example

683
00:55:08,161 --> 00:55:10,860
For example that's the energy time uncertainty relation 

684
00:55:11,169 --> 00:55:19,005
So any pair of things which are related by Fourier expansion 

685
00:55:19,335 --> 00:55:23,487
and this is a Fourier expansions, writing phi of t as a sum or an integral 

686
00:55:23,782 --> 00:55:29,201
over oscillations, any two things which are related in that fashion 

687
00:55:29,531 --> 00:55:31,990
will have the uncertainty principle 

688
00:55:31,990 --> 00:55:33,955
There are lots of other conjugate pairs like this 

689
00:55:34,628 --> 00:55:43,278
The angle of, supposing you have a rigid body rotating about a point

690
00:55:43,621 --> 00:55:48,345
Where the angle theta characterizing its position, 

691
00:55:50,911 --> 00:55:53,112
then the angle theta and the angular momentum 

692
00:55:53,447 --> 00:55:55,878
are exactly in the same kind of relationship 

693
00:55:56,238 --> 00:55:59,813
Uncertainty in angle times uncertainty in angular momentum 

694
00:56:00,061 --> 00:56:02,548
This is also has h bar over two also

695
00:56:05,047 --> 00:56:07,323
So very similar kinds of things 

696
00:56:08,926 --> 00:56:10,741
Any other kinds of questions?

697
00:56:19,858 --> 00:56:21,907
Let's turn to the Schrodinger equation 

698
00:56:32,043 --> 00:56:35,599
The Schrodinger equation is a equation for the way 

699
00:56:35,902 --> 00:56:37,368
wave function changes with time 

700
00:56:46,051 --> 00:56:50,695
It also governs the way expectation values, 

701
00:56:51,013 --> 00:56:53,545
if you know how the wave function changes with time 

702
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:58,454
Then you can try to do how the expectation values of observables 

703
00:56:58,454 --> 00:56:59,135
change with time 

704
00:56:59,504 --> 00:57:03,474
One of the things we would like to do is to see the relationship 

705
00:57:03,792 --> 00:57:10,497
between the motion of wave packets governed by the Schrodinger equation 

706
00:57:10,827 --> 00:57:15,155
and their classical counterparts namely the motion of systems 

707
00:57:15,549 --> 00:57:18,166
Systems in this case being the particle 

708
00:57:18,507 --> 00:57:23,849
We would like to see that as long as the wave packet is narrow 

709
00:57:24,144 --> 00:57:29,631
and not to crazily spread out and not, you know it has a nice bell shaped curve

710
00:57:29,948 --> 00:57:34,508
And stays a bell shaped curve for some length of time 

711
00:57:34,798 --> 00:57:40,665
That the wave functional center of the wave function moves in a way 

712
00:57:41,049 --> 00:57:43,716
which is familiar from classical mechanics 

713
00:57:44,011 --> 00:57:48,916
We need to be able to do that make any relationship between the classical 

714
00:57:49,194 --> 00:57:51,875
and the quantum mechanical things we've been talking about 

715
00:57:52,152 --> 00:57:59,744
Okay now we talked about this, I'm gonna, let's, let's first write the

716
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:05,229
general Schrodinger equation, I'm gonna take you back a couple of lectures now

717
00:58:05,547 --> 00:58:07,370
Take you back a couple of lectures 

718
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:14,387
and go through the derivation of how a wave packet moves 

719
00:58:16,012 --> 00:58:18,826
The answer is the wave packet moves 

720
00:58:19,172 --> 00:58:22,795
so the center satisfies a classical equations of motion 

721
00:58:24,533 --> 00:58:27,437
I'm not going to do that in a new way 

722
00:58:27,758 --> 00:58:30,990
I'm gonna go right back to the old way that we've already talked about 

723
00:58:34,882 --> 00:58:37,862
and to do that, refresh the wall in order to know how the wave function changes

724
00:58:38,459 --> 00:58:39,989
We need to know the Hamiltonian

725
00:58:40,279 --> 00:58:43,598
And let's just remind ourselves how it works 

726
00:58:43,914 --> 00:58:53,478
The way state vectors change with time 

727
00:58:55,085 --> 00:59:00,548
i d psi dt is governed by the Hamiltonian acting on psi

728
00:59:02,265 --> 00:59:05,860
If we let it take for our Hamiltonian 

729
00:59:08,592 --> 00:59:14,951
P squared over two m, that's the Hamiltonian for classical particle 

730
00:59:15,229 --> 00:59:17,752
Why we should take it for a quantum mechanical particles 

731
00:59:18,035 --> 00:59:22,145
It's not obvious, and what might we add to that to put some 

732
00:59:22,464 --> 00:59:24,846
To put the particle in a force field

733
00:59:25,191 --> 00:59:27,647
We might add a potential energy function 

734
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:31,316
Potential energy function might be plus V of x,

735
00:59:32,974 --> 00:59:37,303
Okay so that would be the classical Hamiltonian for particle 

736
00:59:37,627 --> 00:59:40,172
moving in a potential energy function V of x

737
00:59:40,475 --> 00:59:44,948
and we can take that we can lift that right from classical mechanics 

738
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:47,651
and think of it as a quantum mechanical Hamiltonian 

739
00:59:47,977 --> 00:59:50,273
and then check afterwards, 

740
00:59:50,696 --> 00:59:54,969
Is the wave packet really moving the way classical mechanics would say 

741
00:59:55,276 --> 00:59:57,491
that the, that the classical particle moves

742
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:05,418
Alright, so let's try that, in a little while 

743
01:00:05,683 --> 01:00:07,570
we will just work with this abstract equation here

744
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:09,667
but let's just see what it says

745
01:00:09,988 --> 01:00:12,991
A H on psi, H on psi,

746
01:00:13,345 --> 01:00:17,218
Instead of working with abstract ket vectors, 

747
01:00:17,537 --> 01:00:19,256
we can work with wave functions 

748
01:00:19,530 --> 01:00:29,548
and what this equation would say would be i d psi of x by dt is equal, 

749
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:33,145
Now p squared, what is p?

750
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:36,612
p is minus i d by dx, p squared, 

751
01:00:36,948 --> 01:00:42,846
that's minus d by dx squared, or d second by dx squared

752
01:00:43,134 --> 01:00:51,607
There is a one over 2m, minus one over 2m, times psi

753
01:00:52,995 --> 01:00:55,677
But what is V of x? Is V of x an operator?

754
01:00:56,136 --> 01:00:57,896
Yes V of x is an operator

755
01:00:58,248 --> 01:01:01,486
by definition this is a definition now

756
01:01:01,809 --> 01:01:05,538
I told you what the operator x does,

757
01:01:05,847 --> 01:01:12,253
The operator x, we multiplies a wave function, just multiplies it by x 

758
01:01:13,743 --> 01:01:16,993
The corresponding thing for a general V of x

759
01:01:17,291 --> 01:01:20,118
is the meaning of the operator V of x,

760
01:01:20,384 --> 01:01:24,789
is that it multiplies the wave function by V of x

761
01:01:28,664 --> 01:01:32,271
We didn't talk about that much, we didn't talk about functions of x 

762
01:01:32,549 --> 01:01:36,045
The function of x is just defined in the obvious way 

763
01:01:36,378 --> 01:01:41,007
As thought of as operators, they operate on wave functions 

764
01:01:41,297 --> 01:01:43,987
just to multiply it by d of x 

765
01:01:44,297 --> 01:01:47,044
>>

766
01:01:48,771 --> 01:01:53,880
Functions of operators, yes V of x is a function of position

767
01:01:55,447 --> 01:01:59,334
X multiply psi of x, V of x, also multiplies 

768
01:01:59,633 --> 01:02:01,696
and you can take this as definition, 

769
01:02:01,990 --> 01:02:04,833
The, um, when you make a definition of course, 

770
01:02:05,253 --> 01:02:07,442
you later wanna prove that it's a useful definition

771
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:11,340
You not just make definition, you make definitions and then show that 

772
01:02:11,684 --> 01:02:16,709
they are the either are valuable because they are easy to work with 

773
01:02:17,045 --> 01:02:19,610
Or they are valuable because they relate things 

774
01:02:19,925 --> 01:02:21,614
to previous things you already knew 

775
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:25,589
or what I'm wanna shows is that this definition of how V of x acts 

776
01:02:25,898 --> 01:02:31,596
That the Schrodinger equation will in fact make particles move 

777
01:02:31,930 --> 01:02:37,756
according to classical orbits, or at least make wave packets 

778
01:02:38,144 --> 01:02:40,467
insofar as they don't spread too much, 

779
01:02:40,777 --> 01:02:45,129
move according to the classical equations of motion 

780
01:02:45,413 --> 01:02:51,814
Alright so, that's one term, d sec one over 2m 

781
01:02:52,082 --> 01:03:00,606
Second derivative of psi, and the other terms is just plus V of x, times psi of x,

782
01:03:03,675 --> 01:03:08,097
When V of x acts on psi of x, they just multiplies it

783
01:03:08,097 --> 01:03:11,889
And this becomes the Schrödinger equation 

784
01:03:12,339 --> 01:03:16,508
This is the Schrödinger equation for how the wave function changes with time

785
01:03:16,821 --> 01:03:18,660
Also depending on time, 

786
01:03:25,147 --> 01:03:30,157
Let's at the same time write, now I want to do with this 

787
01:03:30,450 --> 01:03:33,555
I'm gonna be interested in d psi by dt 

788
01:03:33,856 --> 01:03:36,593
So I think I'll multiply in a way there is an i

789
01:03:36,902 --> 01:03:39,565
What do we do? If we multiply, if you wanna get rid of an i 

790
01:03:39,866 --> 01:03:41,778
You would multiply by minus i right? 

791
01:03:42,036 --> 01:03:44,125
Minus i times i is one

792
01:03:44,439 --> 01:03:46,142
We multiplied by minus i, 

793
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:48,932
That would give us minus sign with an i here

794
01:03:49,233 --> 01:03:58,361
And put a minus i here, that's psi dot if you like

795
01:03:58,631 --> 01:04:07,421
The left-hand side of psi dot, Let's also write down d psi star of x and t

796
01:04:07,785 --> 01:04:09,495
with respect to t 

797
01:04:09,811 --> 01:04:13,209
It is not a new equation, it's just the complex conjugate of this one 

798
01:04:13,467 --> 01:04:23,855
and that one will be minus i over 2m, d second psi star by d x squared 

799
01:04:27,118 --> 01:04:37,261
plus i V of x, psi of x

800
01:04:39,022 --> 01:04:43,067
>>

801
01:04:43,358 --> 01:04:44,559
I think I got it right,

802
01:04:44,884 --> 01:04:46,834
Did I make a mistake?

803
01:04:48,872 --> 01:04:53,032
Oh yeah, good, psi star

804
01:04:53,328 --> 01:04:55,984
Those are the Schrodinger equations 

805
01:04:56,424 --> 01:04:59,190
They are equivalent to each other, I just wrote them both

806
01:04:59,595 --> 01:05:02,954
Because I'm gonna need them both,

807
01:05:03,294 --> 01:05:15,355
Now what do we wanna do?

808
01:05:15,355 --> 01:05:18,988
We want to see how various expectation values change with time 

809
01:05:19,291 --> 01:05:23,070
If we identify the expectation value with more or less 

810
01:05:23,509 --> 01:05:25,416
the center of the wave packet 

811
01:05:25,708 --> 01:05:28,113
If the wave packet looks like this 

812
01:05:28,452 --> 01:05:31,846
The center of the wave packet will be close to the expectation value 

813
01:05:32,134 --> 01:05:39,977
And so let's identify the center of the wave packet with the expectation value 

814
01:05:40,292 --> 01:05:43,320
and ask how expectation values change with time 

815
01:05:43,668 --> 01:05:46,678
See if we can work it out 

816
01:05:47,018 --> 01:05:51,199
Alright, so let's start with x, let's see if we can calculate d by dt

817
01:05:52,959 --> 01:06:04,464
of the expectation value of x, and that of course is d by dt of the integral 

818
01:06:04,804 --> 01:06:22,591
Psi star of x, x squared, no just x psi of x, dt, d by dt

819
01:06:23,187 --> 01:06:26,526
Another word it's the velocity of the center of the wave packet

820
01:06:27,526 --> 01:06:31,005
That's all this is, it's the velocity of the center of the way packet

821
01:06:31,279 --> 01:06:33,905
Why does it change? 

822
01:06:34,234 --> 01:06:36,460
It changes because psi changes, 

823
01:06:38,052 --> 01:06:39,836
How do we know how psi changes? 

824
01:06:40,148 --> 01:06:43,217
We know how psi changes, because we know the Schrödinger equation

825
01:06:43,529 --> 01:06:48,826
So this is gonna be a little exercise, a little bit too tedious for my taste

826
01:06:49,169 --> 01:06:51,525
To do at the blackboard, it's not very tedious

827
01:06:51,797 --> 01:06:58,041
But still, I may cut little pieces, picks shortcuts 

828
01:06:58,369 --> 01:07:01,278
But I will tell you when I do 

829
01:07:01,582 --> 01:07:05,718
Okay so this is what we want to calculate 

830
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:09,652
and is of course x is just x, it's not dependent on time 

831
01:07:09,997 --> 01:07:12,440
but psi star and psi are dependent on time 

832
01:07:12,727 --> 01:07:16,165
So when I differentiate, I will get the term from each one of these 

833
01:07:16,466 --> 01:07:24,085
and this will give me integral d psi star of this

834
01:07:24,409 --> 01:07:26,181
I will write d by dt,

835
01:07:26,476 --> 01:07:37,023
d psi star, x psi, plus integral psi star x psi dot 

836
01:07:39,658 --> 01:07:43,053
One term coming from differentiating with respect to time psi star

837
01:07:43,322 --> 01:07:47,502
Another from differentiating psi, each one has x in there

838
01:07:47,779 --> 01:07:50,752
And now of course this is just psi star dot,

839
01:07:56,716 --> 01:08:00,637
First thing is we don't really have to calculate both of these 

840
01:08:00,968 --> 01:08:03,314
These are complex conjugates of each other 

841
01:08:03,645 --> 01:08:07,156
We have psi star dot here, we have psi dot here 

842
01:08:07,465 --> 01:08:10,317
We have psi here, psi star here, and x is real

843
01:08:10,652 --> 01:08:15,920
So in fact, all we have to do is calculate one of them 

844
01:08:16,215 --> 01:08:19,031
and add its complex conjugate 

845
01:08:19,353 --> 01:08:25,424
That is all we have to do or equivalently just take twice the real part 

846
01:08:25,740 --> 01:08:29,188
Adding something to its complex conjugate, 

847
01:08:29,513 --> 01:08:33,469
the imaginary parts cancel, and it's twice the real part

848
01:08:33,761 --> 01:08:37,577
So we can use that, I'm not sure I need it, but

849
01:08:37,864 --> 01:08:42,628
let's, It's twice the real part of this 

850
01:08:42,913 --> 01:08:49,373
Twice this, and keep in mind that we throw away anything that's imaginary

851
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:52,641
We throw away anything that is imaginary 

852
01:08:52,919 --> 01:08:55,575
because we add the complex conjugate and we throw it away

853
01:08:55,878 --> 01:09:02,295
Okay so now let's plug in d psi star by dt over here 

854
01:09:02,635 --> 01:09:09,729
And that gives us minus i over to 2m 

855
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:20,691
d second psi, let's see what we do, it's a plus some psi

856
01:09:21,061 --> 01:09:23,858
Plus i, it's the upper equation there, 

857
01:09:24,168 --> 01:09:37,956
d second psi by d x squared, and there is a minus i V of x, psi 

858
01:09:41,608 --> 01:09:45,673
Okay, now the first thing we can see immediately 

859
01:09:46,002 --> 01:09:50,290
is that the term of V of x, is pure imaginary 

860
01:09:50,606 --> 01:09:55,473
The psi star, there is an x, the psi, psi star psi is certainly real

861
01:09:55,787 --> 01:10:00,077
x is real, V of x, the potential energy is real 

862
01:10:00,408 --> 01:10:05,198
And there is an i there, so the first thing to conclude is that 

863
01:10:05,465 --> 01:10:10,482
the V of x doesn't contribute at all, it doesn't contribute at all 

864
01:10:10,774 --> 01:10:14,155
because when you multiply, you add the complex conjugate, it will cancel 

865
01:10:14,515 --> 01:10:18,691
So in this fact in this equation we can throw this away over here

866
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:25,097
Psi star x, V of x psi, that's real, and imaginary part cancels 

867
01:10:25,398 --> 01:10:27,158
So you can throw this away, 

868
01:10:35,244 --> 01:10:38,190
Okay next what's the next? 

869
01:10:39,601 --> 01:10:43,939
Integrate by parts, it's always the next step 

870
01:10:44,230 --> 01:10:50,226
Always the next step integrate by parts 

871
01:10:52,874 --> 01:10:58,536
We have here a derivative, It is the second derivative 

872
01:10:58,839 --> 01:11:00,765
but a second derivative is also a first derivative

873
01:11:01,016 --> 01:11:06,453
Let's write it that way d by dx, of d psi by dx,

874
01:11:06,738 --> 01:11:12,172
incidentally partial derivatives have no, well yeah, they do mean something

875
01:11:12,489 --> 01:11:16,619
They mean the derivatives with respect to x without changing time

876
01:11:16,974 --> 01:11:26,885
So that's our equation and now I want to integrate by parts 

877
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:32,067
which means I want this d by dx over here to shift to the other factor, 

878
01:11:33,588 --> 01:11:36,871
I wanna shift it to the other factor, I'm gonna have two terms 

879
01:11:38,485 --> 01:11:39,975
Let's look at what those two terms are 

880
01:11:40,330 --> 01:11:44,268
The first term, the d by dx will just hit x 

881
01:11:44,570 --> 01:11:48,458
What does that give? What is d by dx? one 

882
01:11:49,848 --> 01:11:57,212
So that will give me twice integral psi star 

883
01:11:57,534 --> 01:12:01,456
The x will disappear when d by dx hits it

884
01:12:01,783 --> 01:12:07,432
and there is d psi by dx, alright d psi by dx, 

885
01:12:12,095 --> 01:12:14,422
This derivative got shifted to here

886
01:12:14,695 --> 01:12:18,121
There is an i, I think over 2m right?

887
01:12:18,455 --> 01:12:23,435
There is an i that I left out, over 2m

888
01:12:27,136 --> 01:12:28,904
Oh, where else did I miss out?

889
01:12:29,269 --> 01:12:40,294
Integration by parts, minus, that's one term 

890
01:12:40,586 --> 01:12:46,525
Now again you might think this is dangerous i here

891
01:12:46,832 --> 01:12:49,607
We should throw it away, because it's imaginary, 

892
01:12:49,864 --> 01:12:51,805
but it's not imaginary its real

893
01:12:52,089 --> 01:12:55,545
We will see that in a moment, 

894
01:12:55,836 --> 01:12:57,953
we will in fact, we will see exactly what it is in a moment 

895
01:12:58,269 --> 01:13:02,568
But lets do the other term, the other turn has an i over 2m

896
01:13:08,252 --> 01:13:15,526
i over 2m, there will be an x, the x does not get differentiated now 

897
01:13:15,906 --> 01:13:20,267
x and then there is d psi star of x, 

898
01:13:20,605 --> 01:13:22,375
and now the derivative hits the psi star,

899
01:13:22,662 --> 01:13:29,873
and we get derivative of psi star times derivative of psi

900
01:13:32,416 --> 01:13:35,231
Okay, this derivative now hits the psi star,

901
01:13:35,601 --> 01:13:41,187
There is an i here, an explicit i, and this is to be integrated over x 

902
01:13:41,536 --> 01:13:44,673
Still underneath the integration here, how about this? 

903
01:13:44,965 --> 01:13:47,971
What's the reality property of this? Is this real or imaginary? 

904
01:13:51,333 --> 01:13:55,840
This is probably a minus, ya there is a minus 

905
01:13:59,315 --> 01:14:05,426
But it's imaginary, this is the complex conjugate of this 

906
01:14:05,726 --> 01:14:11,813
And x is real, so this integral here, the integral here is perfectly real 

907
01:14:12,104 --> 01:14:17,754
it gets multiplied by minus i and then the whole thing is imaginary 

908
01:14:18,064 --> 01:14:22,921
It will get eaten when you add the complex conjugate 

909
01:14:23,230 --> 01:14:36,505
So the only thing that's left is this, i over 2m with a minus sign

910
01:14:38,432 --> 01:14:41,315
Times psi star d psi by dx,

911
01:14:41,695 --> 01:14:43,790
I'm gonna tell you exactly what this is 

912
01:14:44,178 --> 01:14:52,737
What is minus i d by dx? It's p right? It's p

913
01:14:53,021 --> 01:14:58,745
Minus i, d by dx is p, so what this is?

914
01:15:00,236 --> 01:15:12,021
It's the expectation value of p divided by m

915
01:15:12,021 --> 01:15:23,035
P over m, just look at it,  minus i d by dx is the same as p on psi

916
01:15:24,818 --> 01:15:30,054
multiply by psi star, that's the bra vector, integrated over x 

917
01:15:30,302 --> 01:15:33,269
That's just taking the inner product, 

918
01:15:33,544 --> 01:15:39,634
In fact it's real, in fact it is really real 

919
01:15:39,931 --> 01:15:43,727
It looks imaginary because of this, but if you go and study it carefully 

920
01:15:43,989 --> 01:15:45,609
You find its real and what it is 

921
01:15:45,951 --> 01:15:48,996
It is the expectation value of the momentum divided by m

922
01:15:49,446 --> 01:15:52,022
So now we've proved an interesting theorem

923
01:15:52,350 --> 01:16:03,266
We've proved that dx by dt is equal to p over m

924
01:16:04,938 --> 01:16:06,203
We've seen this before, 

925
01:16:06,559 --> 01:16:09,559
this is the classical relation between velocity and momentum 

926
01:16:09,868 --> 01:16:12,417
Mass times velocity is momentum 

927
01:16:12,782 --> 01:16:16,709
Now what we found is that this is going to be 

928
01:16:17,064 --> 01:16:19,746
a feature of the motion of a wave packet

929
01:16:20,005 --> 01:16:23,168
If we have a wave packet that moves in a nice way 

930
01:16:23,475 --> 01:16:24,971
so that it holds itself together 

931
01:16:25,295 --> 01:16:27,998
What you may or may not do, but if it does, 

932
01:16:27,998 --> 01:16:32,461
If for an regime of parameters with a wave packet moves 

933
01:16:34,584 --> 01:16:40,363
like a nice, nice wave packet, then we will find that 

934
01:16:40,810 --> 01:16:44,601
the expectation value, it's momentum defined in this way 

935
01:16:44,915 --> 01:16:49,740
will be related to the expectation value of the velocity of the wave packet

936
01:16:50,183 --> 01:16:53,535
through the standard classical mechanical equations 

937
01:16:53,838 --> 01:17:00,093
Okay that's half of mechanics, what's the other half of mechanics? 

938
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:05,663
We found that d p, oops, I just give it away

939
01:17:05,925 --> 01:17:09,890
dx by dt is p over m, what's the other half?

940
01:17:10,202 --> 01:17:13,567
dp by dt, that is Newton's law

941
01:17:13,898 --> 01:17:16,468
time derivative of momentum is called force

942
01:17:16,806 --> 01:17:21,255
So let's see if we can do the same thing with momentum 

943
01:17:21,611 --> 01:17:28,610
>> you said that if everything is presented nicely

944
01:17:29,013 --> 01:17:34,308
>> we didn't have a nice assumption of theorization 

945
01:17:34,653 --> 01:17:38,932
>>it just look classically it fit in nicely

946
01:17:39,181 --> 01:17:46,866
Right, ya, there was no there was no assumption here 

947
01:17:47,178 --> 01:17:51,482
There will be as we'll see a certain assumption in the other equation 

948
01:17:51,887 --> 01:17:54,910
No assumption here of that type,

949
01:17:56,917 --> 01:18:02,239
If the wave packet is really crazy, it might not mean anything very sensible 

950
01:18:02,524 --> 01:18:05,260
but still, that was a, 

951
01:18:10,367 --> 01:18:12,721
Nothing I get up till now depended on 

952
01:18:13,057 --> 01:18:19,574
the approximate notion of how wave packet moves 

953
01:18:22,767 --> 01:18:24,576
Okay we got this, 

954
01:18:27,649 --> 01:18:30,516
Let's see if we can get the other half

955
01:18:30,869 --> 01:18:32,655
Now I don't guaranteed to get through it 

956
01:18:32,968 --> 01:18:38,749
without all sorts of errors and i and minuses

957
01:18:39,064 --> 01:18:40,383
Let's try this one, 

958
01:18:43,464 --> 01:18:49,097
p the average of p is gotten by acting with p on psi

959
01:18:49,393 --> 01:18:54,787
And that's minus i, that would give us minus i which I will put over here

960
01:18:55,060 --> 01:19:03,095
But then, d by dx, d psi by dx

961
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:08,177
We could put the d psi, we could put the derivative over here

962
01:19:08,479 --> 01:19:11,840
integration by parts, the sign change but I will leave it over here 

963
01:19:12,175 --> 01:19:24,926
>>remain of x

964
01:19:25,299 --> 01:19:26,394
>>

965
01:19:26,727 --> 01:19:27,493
>>

966
01:19:27,811 --> 01:19:31,652
No, no, we want the time derivative of the momentum 

967
01:19:31,979 --> 01:19:33,339
What would you like to see? 

968
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:35,865
You want to see the time derivative of the momentum?

969
01:19:36,142 --> 01:19:40,949
It is governed, let's write this equation 

970
01:19:42,685 --> 01:19:45,521
P dot is equal to force, that's it, 

971
01:19:45,877 --> 01:19:50,240
What is force in terms of the things I've written on the blackboard?

972
01:19:52,293 --> 01:19:58,236
Minus dV by dx, so this is what I am gonna show,

973
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:03,303
minus dV by dx, but I will show it in the form that 

974
01:20:03,577 --> 01:20:08,774
d by dt of  the expectation value of the momentum 

975
01:20:09,072 --> 01:20:14,469
It is minus the expectation value of dV by dx,

976
01:20:17,467 --> 01:20:22,360
dV by dx is also a function of x, since V is a function of x

977
01:20:22,627 --> 01:20:25,117
dV by dx is a function of x,

978
01:20:25,424 --> 01:20:32,835
It's called the force, or what this says is 

979
01:20:33,142 --> 01:20:37,788
the average rate of change of momentum is the average of the force 

980
01:20:38,085 --> 01:20:44,298
The force, dV by dx with a minus sign

981
01:20:44,571 --> 01:20:47,033
Okay so that's what we wanna show,

982
01:20:47,278 --> 01:20:53,690
We wanna show dp by dt is dv dx, that's all

983
01:20:54,004 --> 01:20:57,079
And how we're gonna show it?

984
01:20:57,446 --> 01:21:00,125
Once again I'm gonna show it by using Schrödinger equation 

985
01:21:00,438 --> 01:21:08,983
It tell us how things change with time 

986
01:21:09,289 --> 01:21:23,198
Okay so let's see now, It's a little bit unpleasant I'm not sure 

987
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:35,484
Alright, when I debating, let's start working it out then let's

988
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:38,624
At some point I may say well I know this goes away and this doesn't go away

989
01:21:39,084 --> 01:21:40,406
We will say how it goes

990
01:21:40,730 --> 01:21:52,233
So first of all this goes as the integral psi star dot times d psi by dx, minus i

991
01:21:52,580 --> 01:21:56,473
And then there is another term where that come from

992
01:21:56,821 --> 01:21:59,055
differentiating psi star with respect to time

993
01:21:59,370 --> 01:22:04,009
There is gonna to be another term where d by dt will hit psi

994
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:06,296
Okay, so what will that be?

995
01:22:06,655 --> 01:22:11,819
That will be again minus i, integral psi star,

996
01:22:12,140 --> 01:22:17,052
Now the order of differentiation doesn't matter 

997
01:22:17,355 --> 01:22:27,447
So this can be written as d by dx of psi dot

998
01:22:32,689 --> 01:22:35,478
Just wondering at one point I'm gonna regret 

999
01:22:35,781 --> 01:22:37,786
not having done integration by parts 

1000
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:40,654
But it won't matter because we do the integration by parts 

1001
01:22:40,962 --> 01:22:44,141
I will regret it, I will regret it, I will just go ahead

1002
01:22:46,936 --> 01:22:48,124
Is there an extra i? 

1003
01:22:51,641 --> 01:22:55,762
No I don't think, no I don't think so

1004
01:22:56,155 --> 01:22:58,532
I think it's right, okay, 

1005
01:23:02,717 --> 01:23:09,692
Oh you know what, I think it will be convenient to integrate this one by parts 

1006
01:23:10,089 --> 01:23:15,506
If I integrate this one by parts I will get a plus i here 

1007
01:23:15,804 --> 01:23:25,447
and d psi star by dx here, another reason it's convenient is 

1008
01:23:25,745 --> 01:23:30,480
because the thing in here is the complex conjugate of thing here 

1009
01:23:32,575 --> 01:23:36,943
Psi dot star, well that's a complex conjugate of psi dot,

1010
01:23:37,247 --> 01:23:41,176
d psi by dx, that's the complex conjugate of psi star

1011
01:23:41,549 --> 01:23:44,996
But notice it's i times the difference

1012
01:23:45,357 --> 01:23:50,920
What do I get when I take i times the difference of two complex conjugates?

1013
01:23:52,826 --> 01:23:54,853
You get a real thing again

1014
01:23:56,655 --> 01:24:06,118
So I think it's just the real part of this? 

1015
01:24:07,819 --> 01:24:12,233
Well let's just keep going on, my eye, let's just keep going

1016
01:24:12,552 --> 01:24:16,701
We can erase this and remember in the end

1017
01:24:18,856 --> 01:24:22,985
That the answer has to be twice the real part of this 

1018
01:24:24,575 --> 01:24:29,648
twice the real part of this, and we don't have to keep track of both of them 

1019
01:24:29,978 --> 01:24:34,106
Okay now what do we do? We plug in the Schrödinger equation

1020
01:24:34,436 --> 01:24:36,684
And pray like mad that all goes well 

1021
01:24:38,317 --> 01:24:44,215
Okay so psi dot is equal to i over 2m

1022
01:24:46,477 --> 01:24:59,474
d second psi by dx square minus i V of x psi,

1023
01:25:07,037 --> 01:25:10,669
This i cancels this i gives us the minus sign

1024
01:25:11,002 --> 01:25:14,448
Well this i here so we make minus

1025
01:25:16,287 --> 01:25:22,728
and the i over here time the i over here, I think it will make a plus, plus

1026
01:25:27,494 --> 01:25:34,090
We have some of the unpleasant thing, how unpleasant let's see

1027
01:25:40,076 --> 01:25:53,671
Not too bad, this piece I believe is pure imaginary, it is, it is,

1028
01:25:54,495 --> 01:25:56,686
This is pure imaginary over here,

1029
01:25:56,978 --> 01:26:03,802
The way you see it, the way you see it is again integrate by parts 

1030
01:26:04,166 --> 01:26:08,841
Just this piece here, if I integrate this piece by parts 

1031
01:26:09,183 --> 01:26:13,501
We will get a derivative, we will get a term with a single derivative of psi

1032
01:26:13,809 --> 01:26:16,166
And a second derivative of psi star, 

1033
01:26:16,451 --> 01:26:26,082
Okay, what we will discover is basically the difference between a thing 

1034
01:26:26,476 --> 01:26:27,895
and its complex conjugate 

1035
01:26:28,163 --> 01:26:33,540
There will be a minus sign, let's just see it here, ya let's do it

1036
01:26:33,826 --> 01:26:36,755
If I differentiate, oh sorry, integrate it by parts 

1037
01:26:37,062 --> 01:26:46,076
That'll bring, the derivative over to here 

1038
01:26:51,437 --> 01:26:55,529
It's pure imaginary, I know that it is 

1039
01:26:55,848 --> 01:26:59,725
Whenever you have a quantity complex conjugated

1040
01:27:00,075 --> 01:27:03,970
Times a derivative of the unconjugated thing you integrated 

1041
01:27:04,275 --> 01:27:05,963
Tt's always pure imaginary,

1042
01:27:06,321 --> 01:27:08,734
We have used this trick before 

1043
01:27:08,734 --> 01:27:10,832
I'll just tell you right now this piece is pure imaginary 

1044
01:27:11,190 --> 01:27:13,964
It's not gonna be of any significance 

1045
01:27:14,321 --> 01:27:27,763
The significant piece is integral d psi star by dx, V of x psi

1046
01:27:28,101 --> 01:27:31,385
That's all it's left after we take into account the 

1047
01:27:31,661 --> 01:27:38,271
Little intricate details of complex conjugation V of x

1048
01:27:47,603 --> 01:27:49,867
I can't remember whether we doubled it or not yet

1049
01:27:56,818 --> 01:28:01,942
I think we doubled it, I think we doubled it, ya we have to double this

1050
01:28:07,210 --> 01:28:10,084
Or add it to it's complex conjugate did I say it right?

1051
01:28:10,537 --> 01:28:13,007
Add it to it's complex conjugate, I think

1052
01:28:14,563 --> 01:28:15,997
In fact let's do that right now

1053
01:28:16,370 --> 01:28:25,375
Let's add it to it's complex conjugate plus the integral of psi star V of x

1054
01:28:25,683 --> 01:28:34,622
d psi by dx, alright let's take this and complex conjugate it

1055
01:28:34,949 --> 01:28:39,723
I've taken this and complex conjugate this, and it is real

1056
01:28:40,010 --> 01:28:49,819
Okay now we are almost there, we have d psi star of x dx times psi

1057
01:28:50,124 --> 01:28:52,989
Let's pull out V of x, pull away out here 

1058
01:28:53,313 --> 01:29:06,374
V of x times this

1059
01:29:06,786 --> 01:29:08,468
Now what is d psi? 

1060
01:29:08,469 --> 01:29:16,131
d psi star by dx times psi plus psi star times d psi by dx

1061
01:29:16,231 --> 01:29:18,953
It is the derivative of psi star psi with respect to x

1062
01:29:19,378 --> 01:29:26,571
This is derivative of psi star times psi, plus psi star times the derivative of psi

1063
01:29:26,939 --> 01:29:32,319
That is nothing but the derivative with respect to x of psi star psi

1064
01:29:32,664 --> 01:29:34,202
So let's put that in, 

1065
01:29:44,527 --> 01:29:50,791
And the next step integrate by parts 

1066
01:29:52,405 --> 01:29:56,802
Integrate by parts that will take the derivative, derivative over here

1067
01:29:57,156 --> 01:30:11,777
And it will give me minus the integral of psi star psi, times dV of x 

1068
01:30:14,288 --> 01:30:20,273
If I put the psi here on the right, and what is this thing?

1069
01:30:20,603 --> 01:30:28,495
The integral of psi star psi times dV dx, that's the expectation value of dV dx

1070
01:30:30,499 --> 01:30:35,586
This whole thing is dx minus the expectation value of dV dx

1071
01:30:35,935 --> 01:30:38,234
In other words it's exactly this 

1072
01:30:40,015 --> 01:30:48,082
So we found after a slight bit of painful integration by parts 

1073
01:30:48,416 --> 01:30:51,088
a little bit of algebra, and throwing away some things 

1074
01:30:51,475 --> 01:30:53,359
which I told you they are pure imaginary which they were 

1075
01:30:53,654 --> 01:30:59,508
We find that dp by dt is exactly equal to minus dv by dx

1076
01:30:59,886 --> 01:31:04,328
But in the sense of expectation values, in the sense of the expectation value

1077
01:31:06,036 --> 01:31:10,765
You know why do I say, this this also is exact 

1078
01:31:11,074 --> 01:31:15,517
I didn't do anything illegal here, I didn't do any approximation 

1079
01:31:21,084 --> 01:31:28,866
I will tell you where the use or where it maybe important that 

1080
01:31:29,168 --> 01:31:30,731
the wave packet have a nice shape 

1081
01:31:32,464 --> 01:31:41,662
The expectation value of dV by dX is not the same as 

1082
01:31:41,943 --> 01:31:53,191
V or d, let's just take V, the expectation value of V of x

1083
01:31:55,443 --> 01:31:57,371
No let's call it F of x, force,

1084
01:31:57,681 --> 01:32:04,765
The expectation value of F of x which is after all minus dV by dx

1085
01:32:05,067 --> 01:32:08,640
The expectation value of function of x is not the same thing

1086
01:32:08,966 --> 01:32:17,320
As the function of the expectation value of x

1087
01:32:18,901 --> 01:32:24,375
This represents the expectation value of X at the center of the wave packet 

1088
01:32:24,669 --> 01:32:29,277
and this is a function at the center of the wave packet 

1089
01:32:29,826 --> 01:32:32,166
It is not the same thing as a thing we calculated in general

1090
01:32:32,486 --> 01:32:36,402
This is the expectation value of F of x 

1091
01:32:36,765 --> 01:32:39,882
When they give you an example with a very very different 

1092
01:32:40,175 --> 01:32:46,010
They could be extremely different, suppose for example that 

1093
01:32:46,338 --> 01:32:52,763
F were equal to X squared 

1094
01:32:53,059 --> 01:32:56,179
Supposing the force happen to be X squared 

1095
01:32:56,554 --> 01:33:00,745
And supposing the wave packet consisted of a pair of bumps 

1096
01:33:02,483 --> 01:33:06,230
Is that what I want? I think that's what I want 

1097
01:33:06,565 --> 01:33:09,032
Yes that is exactly what I want 

1098
01:33:09,335 --> 01:33:16,951
What? Centered around zero. What is the expectation value of X? 

1099
01:33:18,771 --> 01:33:24,437
What's the F of the expectation value of x? Zero right?

1100
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:29,117
On the other hand what was the expectation value of X squared? 

1101
01:33:30,582 --> 01:33:36,263
So enough zero, this one has an X squared equal to the X squared of this

1102
01:33:36,603 --> 01:33:38,467
It's certainly nonzero 

1103
01:33:38,805 --> 01:33:44,934
So when wave packets are nice, not nice single bumps 

1104
01:33:45,259 --> 01:33:48,484
which are mainly characterized by the center like this

1105
01:33:48,833 --> 01:33:52,511
Then in general you could not write that 

1106
01:33:52,821 --> 01:33:58,338
the time rate of change of the momentum is equal to 

1107
01:33:58,736 --> 01:34:03,015
the force evaluated at the expectation value of X 

1108
01:34:03,546 --> 01:34:07,237
It's only if the wave functions are nice 

1109
01:34:07,559 --> 01:34:14,887
And so that concentrated over a fairly narrow range 

1110
01:34:15,247 --> 01:34:17,919
If you concentrate over a reasonably narrow range 

1111
01:34:18,261 --> 01:34:26,424
then the expectation value of F of X is the same as the F of the expectation value

1112
01:34:26,769 --> 01:34:33,411
This is where we have achieved a little bit in saying 

1113
01:34:33,739 --> 01:34:35,371
This looks like a classical equation of motion 

1114
01:34:35,699 --> 01:34:39,537
that depends on the wave packet, they are nice and coherent and localized 

1115
01:34:39,873 --> 01:34:43,144
One of the circumstances under which 

1116
01:34:43,406 --> 01:34:45,810
a wave function will remain nicely localized 

1117
01:34:46,190 --> 01:34:47,848
I will tell you what the circumstances are 

1118
01:34:48,271 --> 01:34:51,590
The circumstances are the particle is heavy, 

1119
01:34:51,983 --> 01:34:56,732
If the particle is heavy and takes two things 

1120
01:34:57,022 --> 01:35:02,115
the particle being fairly heavy and the potential energy 

1121
01:35:02,422 --> 01:35:06,607
not having too many spikes that having spikes in it or something like that 

1122
01:35:06,992 --> 01:35:09,653
Spikes when the wave function hit spikes, 

1123
01:35:10,023 --> 01:35:13,058
it tends to break up, for example 

1124
01:35:13,398 --> 01:35:17,650
If you have some sort of wave function coming in a nice way,

1125
01:35:18,001 --> 01:35:20,329
Wave packet coming in going to the right 

1126
01:35:20,647 --> 01:35:26,193
And it hits a point structure here, what will it do?

1127
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:31,166
It will spread out all over the place like that 

1128
01:35:31,471 --> 01:35:35,200
Wave function will disintegrate all over the place 

1129
01:35:35,487 --> 01:35:42,446
If on the other hand it hits a very smooth potential of some sort 

1130
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:47,036
Then it will go through the smooth potential 

1131
01:35:47,326 --> 01:35:50,578
moving more or less according to the classical equations of motion 

1132
01:35:50,882 --> 01:35:55,892
So you know, we don't expect quantum mechanics 

1133
01:35:56,373 --> 01:35:59,010
to reproduce classical mechanics in every possible circumstance 

1134
01:35:59,299 --> 01:36:02,963
We expect it to reproduce quantum mechanics in circumstances 

1135
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:09,961
where particles are heavy and where potentials are nice and smooth 

1136
01:36:10,360 --> 01:36:13,127
and don't cause a wave function to break up into little pieces 

1137
01:36:13,429 --> 01:36:15,616
Or disintegrate or scatter all over the place 

1138
01:36:15,875 --> 01:36:25,241
Okay, let's see if there are any other odds and ends that I want to 

1139
01:36:25,531 --> 01:36:29,870
You know not tonight, we don't have time for it 

1140
01:36:37,957 --> 01:36:39,794
>> what sort of physical situation 

1141
01:36:40,176 --> 01:36:46,488
>> will correspond to potentials that break up the wave packet?

1142
01:36:46,831 --> 01:36:56,154
Well, the situation which is bad tends to be when 

1143
01:36:56,454 --> 01:37:04,410
When the potential has structures and features in it

1144
01:37:06,094 --> 01:37:09,187
which let's say have some sign associated with them 

1145
01:37:09,485 --> 01:37:11,851
Some structure which we could call delta x

1146
01:37:12,181 --> 01:37:14,534
Some sign associated with the structure here 

1147
01:37:14,864 --> 01:37:18,941
And where delta x is significantly smaller 

1148
01:37:19,341 --> 01:37:22,941
than the uncertainty in position of the particle 

1149
01:37:24,565 --> 01:37:30,395
If the structures of the, what do we wanna call it then,

1150
01:37:30,717 --> 01:37:35,121
The features sharp features of the wave function take place on the scale 

1151
01:37:35,449 --> 01:37:42,890
which is much smaller than the, than the size of the incoming wave packet 

1152
01:37:43,237 --> 01:37:47,274
Then it will break up the wave function into a lot of the pieces 

1153
01:37:47,605 --> 01:37:51,371
Each one will scatter the scatter of different dimensions 

1154
01:37:51,677 --> 01:37:53,118
into different directions, 

1155
01:37:58,668 --> 01:37:59,964
Okay let's

1156
01:38:01,666 --> 01:38:07,188
>> In the case of  Classical mechanics

1157
01:38:07,588 --> 01:38:10,507
>> itself, it's working out right?

1158
01:38:13,757 --> 01:38:15,081
No no no you shouldn't expect

1159
01:38:18,488 --> 01:38:25,608
Basically when the features in the potential are shorter than the wavelength 

1160
01:38:25,968 --> 01:38:27,576
shorter than the wavelength of the of the particle 

1161
01:38:27,927 --> 01:38:30,779
It will break it up into, alright

1162
01:38:35,452 --> 01:38:43,469
Now if you were to take a bowling ball and you would ask what is delta x? 

1163
01:38:54,024 --> 01:38:58,591
Well let's see, typically it's true that, typically delta p times delta x 

1164
01:38:58,982 --> 01:39:04,344
the rule is bigger than h bar, but in many reasonable cases it's of order h bar 

1165
01:39:06,439 --> 01:39:12,869
Now p that's about as concentrated as you can get it

1166
01:39:13,541 --> 01:39:15,236
But ordinary macroscopic object, 

1167
01:39:15,697 --> 01:39:18,402
the uncertainty principle is pretty well saturated 

1168
01:39:18,691 --> 01:39:22,491
delta p times delta x is more or less about equal to h bar

1169
01:39:22,906 --> 01:39:26,757
Why that is so is a very complicated question, but very complicated

1170
01:39:27,143 --> 01:39:31,315
What is delta p? Delta p is the mass times the delta velocity 

1171
01:39:33,027 --> 01:39:36,847
So uncertainty of velocity times the uncertainty in position 

1172
01:39:37,170 --> 01:39:45,037
is h bar over m, and if I put a bowling ball down on the ground 

1173
01:39:45,367 --> 01:39:48,616
You know very well that the uncertainty of velocity is not very big

1174
01:39:50,415 --> 01:39:53,415
The uncertainty of the velocity is, in particulars, 

1175
01:39:53,712 --> 01:39:56,597
as it gets heavier and heavier you might expect the uncertainty in the velocity 

1176
01:39:57,028 --> 01:39:58,276
get smaller and smaller 

1177
01:39:58,591 --> 01:40:12,373
In any case, there is an m down here, and so whatever delta v is

1178
01:40:12,760 --> 01:40:17,278
as m gets small, as m gets smaller and smaller 

1179
01:40:18,155 --> 01:40:22,483
delta x will get bigger and bigger right? 

1180
01:40:22,483 --> 01:40:25,454
delta x will get bigger and bigger, right

1181
01:40:26,803 --> 01:40:31,357
And in particular it will tend to get bigger than the features in the 

1182
01:40:31,711 --> 01:40:37,473
in the potential, So in a highly quantum mechanical limit 

1183
01:40:37,842 --> 01:40:40,641
where mass is very small and delta X tends to be big 

1184
01:40:42,390 --> 01:40:47,823
The wave function will move under the influence of a ragged potential 

1185
01:40:48,132 --> 01:40:53,291
which are which it sees as being much sharper and much more featured 

1186
01:40:53,575 --> 01:40:56,059
than wave function itself, that's when it breaks up 

1187
01:40:56,378 --> 01:40:58,747
On the other hand as m gets very large 

1188
01:40:59,104 --> 01:41:05,427
delta x gets small, delta x will tend to get small, as as m gets very large 

1189
01:41:05,739 --> 01:41:08,060
and so for a large bowling ball 

1190
01:41:08,457 --> 01:41:11,430
the wave packet might be very very concentrated 

1191
01:41:11,733 --> 01:41:15,787
and when it moves through here, it moves slowly like a tiny wave function 

1192
01:41:15,787 --> 01:41:21,203
and the tiny wave function thinks that these features are very very broad

1193
01:41:21,509 --> 01:41:27,380
moving through broad smooth features doesn't disrupt the wave function 

1194
01:41:27,710 --> 01:41:29,118
and break it up into pieces 

1195
01:41:31,853 --> 01:41:36,974
So large mass smooth potentials is the limit of classical physics 

1196
01:41:37,309 --> 01:41:41,863
light mass and abrupt potentials is more quantum mechanical 

1197
01:41:43,958 --> 01:41:49,379
>>Just to get a feel about what you mean about large and small

1198
01:41:49,664 --> 01:41:56,451
>>if you, an electron, large enough to be of classical 

1199
01:41:56,789 --> 01:41:57,896
>>

1200
01:41:58,207 --> 01:42:02,985
It's the interplay between the shape of the potential and the mass 

1201
01:42:04,734 --> 01:42:11,217
If you take a very very smooth potential of the kind that you might make 

1202
01:42:11,593 --> 01:42:13,616
let's say a couple of capacitor plates, 

1203
01:42:13,983 --> 01:42:18,898
capacitor plates separated by a meter, well not a meter, a centimeter 

1204
01:42:20,255 --> 01:42:23,920
Where the smooth electric field between them 

1205
01:42:24,304 --> 01:42:31,521
Then the electron will move through it in a nice coherent 

1206
01:42:31,822 --> 01:42:34,749
as most classical particle do

1207
01:42:35,109 --> 01:42:38,259
On the other hand if you take the potential associated with the with the 

1208
01:42:38,598 --> 01:42:44,760
core of the atom, the nucleus, that has a sharp feature in it 

1209
01:42:45,136 --> 01:42:49,937
And that sharp feature will, if an electron wave comes in and hits it 

1210
01:42:50,276 --> 01:42:52,140
It will scatter all over the place, 

1211
01:42:52,483 --> 01:42:58,022
so it's a interplay between the mass and the sharpness of the potential 

1212
01:42:58,373 --> 01:43:03,049
>>Can you do an experiment to show that

1213
01:43:03,430 --> 01:43:04,469
Absolutely, 

1214
01:43:16,019 --> 01:43:19,447
Of course you can do it, no problem, electron very easy

1215
01:43:19,798 --> 01:43:22,908
The classic experiment was done in 1911 

1216
01:43:24,455 --> 01:43:29,055
It wasn't done with electrons, it was done with alpha particles 

1217
01:43:30,961 --> 01:43:34,947
Alpha particles come in and hit the gold nucleus 

1218
01:43:35,343 --> 01:43:40,392
Gold nucleus is a small thing, and the result was that 

1219
01:43:40,737 --> 01:43:42,978
the gold nucleus when the alpha particle comes in 

1220
01:43:43,293 --> 01:43:46,495
The wave or quantum mechanical wave of alpha particles comes in 

1221
01:43:46,888 --> 01:43:50,360
Hits that tiny gold nucleus, and it get scattered in all directions 

1222
01:43:52,204 --> 01:43:55,445
That's why Rutherford was a bit surprised to see that 

1223
01:43:57,135 --> 01:44:00,416
To see alpha particles get scattered right back at him 

1224
01:44:00,732 --> 01:44:04,583
And what does it tell him? It tell him the nucleus was very small 

1225
01:44:21,140 --> 01:44:26,356
He just have a beam of alpha particles some of which hit the center

1226
01:44:26,356 --> 01:44:27,190
Some of which went through here, 

1227
01:44:29,151 --> 01:44:31,808
Alright, but in fact what we really had was a wave 

1228
01:44:33,932 --> 01:44:38,746
And the wave came in hit the tiny gold nucleus 

1229
01:44:38,746 --> 01:44:40,451
and get scattered all over the place 

1230
01:44:43,231 --> 01:44:46,702
And with electrons, yeah, sure, you are gonna use it

1231
01:44:50,328 --> 01:44:53,490
That's what happen to accelerators when electrons 

1232
01:44:54,162 --> 01:45:02,511
hit small targets, oh photons do also, photons do also 

1233
01:45:02,785 --> 01:45:09,666
Electromagnetic waves as they hit the structure of objects 

1234
01:45:10,026 --> 01:45:12,352
with structure smaller, smaller than the wavelength 

1235
01:45:12,659 --> 01:45:14,202
they get scatter all over the place 

1236
01:45:19,728 --> 01:45:24,602
If they hit very smooth things they tend to propagate 

1237
01:45:24,954 --> 01:45:26,730
according to the geometric optics 

1238
01:45:27,055 --> 01:45:30,335
For example if you have a piece of material 

1239
01:45:32,060 --> 01:45:35,749
with a position varying index of refraction 

1240
01:45:36,065 --> 01:45:40,316
If that index of refraction is varying very smoothly very slowly 

1241
01:45:40,704 --> 01:45:43,244
over the wavelength of the photon 

1242
01:45:43,570 --> 01:45:46,852
Then geometric optics is a good approximation 

1243
01:45:47,231 --> 01:45:50,803
If on the other hand you have a diffraction grating of 

1244
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:57,851
distance comparable or smaller than the wavelength of the radiation 

1245
01:45:58,273 --> 01:46:01,613
Diffraction grating will spread out all over the place 

1246
01:46:02,053 --> 01:46:06,444
So it's it's not just the electrons electrons protons and anything

1247
01:46:09,377 --> 01:46:13,064
Okay, if there are no other questions, 

1248
01:46:13,366 --> 01:46:17,256
I'm gonna go home, my son have a baby

1249
01:46:26,784 --> 01:46:29,565
