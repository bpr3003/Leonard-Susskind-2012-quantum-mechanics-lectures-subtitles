1
00:00:04,468 --> 00:00:07,317
Stanford University

2
00:00:08,853 --> 00:00:11,789
I gather you people have a lot of fun with entanglement 

3
00:00:12,157 --> 00:00:14,725
It is a good subject  I mean it really is

4
00:00:15,653 --> 00:00:17,749
absolutely the heart of quantum mechanics,

5
00:00:21,364 --> 00:00:29,788
but of course yeah I mean, I would say up until now we have really studied 

6
00:00:30,428 --> 00:00:34,252
the foundations of quantum mechanics in very very simple systems 

7
00:00:35,372 --> 00:00:38,420
And the foundations have been laid out they've been exposed 

8
00:00:38,732 --> 00:00:41,900
you know what they are, and really the only thing left to do now 

9
00:00:43,077 --> 00:00:44,140
is to study some examples 

10
00:00:45,196 --> 00:00:46,436
>>Can I ask a question? 

11
00:00:47,884 --> 00:00:51,172
>> So in the classical mechanics you started with a very small number of 

12
00:00:52,953 --> 00:00:59,169
>>empirical observation by Newton more or less

13
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:00,308
More or less

14
00:01:01,012 --> 00:01:03,716
>>So what's the equivalent in the case of the quantum mechanics?

15
00:01:04,284 --> 00:01:06,720
>>What are those basic atomic empirical observations 

16
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,201
You mean historically?

17
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,105
>>Well the minimal set that you need

18
00:01:11,188 --> 00:01:15,529
well I would say the minimum set is what we describe 

19
00:01:16,873 --> 00:01:18,668
when we talk about an apparatus which you can rotate 

20
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:26,932
a spin and the window and the apparatus that was zero and one 

21
00:01:27,684 --> 00:01:29,636
That would logically be the simplest thing you can do 

22
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:32,260
is of course not the way quantum mechanics was discovered 

23
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:41,466
But just analyzing the experimental data that you would get 

24
00:01:41,467 --> 00:01:44,693
by taking an electron or spin

25
00:01:46,388 --> 00:01:51,948
orienting your, your detector, pressing the M button the measure button 

26
00:01:52,396 --> 00:01:55,871
and getting a one or minus one on the screen 

27
00:01:56,311 --> 00:02:00,729
doing this over and over and over again accumulating statistics 

28
00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:05,481
Ah...It's the simplest thing you can do

29
00:02:05,981 --> 00:02:07,823
>>You have to do that for each physical properties like momentums 

30
00:02:08,047 --> 00:02:09,525
spin and so on

31
00:02:14,922 --> 00:02:15,236
>>On the system we described about the singlet and triplet 

32
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:19,166
>>and the photon going out, 

33
00:02:19,218 --> 00:02:22,589
You said you can capture the photon and reflect it back

34
00:02:23,405 --> 00:02:26,884
>> Is that because you have a system with a Singlet and triplet?

35
00:02:26,996 --> 00:02:27,318
>>Or can any other photons also cause this entanglement?~

36
00:02:30,396 --> 00:02:32,524
No. But that's a good question 

37
00:02:33,844 --> 00:02:42,212
Well...En...You don't have a photon out there. 

38
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,252
You have a photon or you don't photon 

39
00:02:46,636 --> 00:02:54,679
The radiation field itself is not in the state of positive..

40
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:58,565
Whether or not you have a photon out there could also be thought of 

41
00:02:58,797 --> 00:03:01,431
as zero or one.

42
00:03:02,071 --> 00:03:06,015
The radiation state itself.  The radiation system itself

43
00:03:06,016 --> 00:03:08,863
could be modeled by having another degree of freedom

44
00:03:10,112 --> 00:03:14,736
and the other degree of freedom could also have the zero or one 

45
00:03:15,372 --> 00:03:19,954
The zero would mean no photon present one would be in the photon present 

46
00:03:19,955 --> 00:03:20,268
okay

47
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:25,636
so what happens?Let's suppose we start with

48
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:29,780
a singlet and the triplet superposed in this way 

49
00:03:30,268 --> 00:03:34,932
with no photons, alright so to express the fact that 

50
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:39,828
there are no photons we have to put another degree of freedom in here 

51
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:44,768
and we have to say this is a tensor product 

52
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:48,316
with the state of the radiation field

53
00:03:48,612 --> 00:03:53,137
which has no photons, that's the story, Keep in mind

54
00:03:53,705 --> 00:03:56,512
this here represents the two electrons

55
00:03:56,929 --> 00:03:58,329
either in the singlet state of the triplet state 

56
00:03:58,552 --> 00:04:03,129
and this represents the state of the, of the radiation field 

57
00:04:03,752 --> 00:04:05,232
now if you wait for a little while 

58
00:04:07,504 --> 00:04:10,856
and while the electrons are entangled here 

59
00:04:12,114 --> 00:04:14,138
they are not entangled with the radiation field 

60
00:04:14,578 --> 00:04:19,154
This is a simple product of a vacuum of photons 

61
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:27,754
no photons and a particular state of the, of the electron pair 

62
00:04:28,122 --> 00:04:30,138
in fact I said this was entangled this is not entangled 

63
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:34,178
this combination was just up down 

64
00:04:34,962 --> 00:04:37,074
Alright let it evolve for a while,

65
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:42,418
what happens is the singlet state is the singlet 

66
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:51,018
and it does not emit a photon but the triplet 

67
00:04:51,674 --> 00:04:52,490
what happens to it?

68
00:04:53,378 --> 00:04:59,570
it becomes the singlet and emits a photon 

69
00:05:02,314 --> 00:05:03,970
So what happens to the state ?

70
00:05:04,562 --> 00:05:10,259
it is evolves into linear combination of singlet times 

71
00:05:11,091 --> 00:05:15,195
no photon and one photon . Another words,

72
00:05:15,563 --> 00:05:18,931
the singlet electron,  it's a singlet state of the electron pair,

73
00:05:19,915 --> 00:05:24,891
but a linear superposition, quantum linear superposition 

74
00:05:25,627 --> 00:05:27,987
of no photon and one photon

75
00:05:28,938 --> 00:05:30,803
That seems a little bit strange, 

76
00:05:31,179 --> 00:05:32,051
but it's an important idea 

77
00:05:32,755 --> 00:05:36,467
that you can not only superposed states of a particle 

78
00:05:36,859 --> 00:05:39,443
you can superposed the number of particles 

79
00:05:40,683 --> 00:05:43,403
No particle and one particle could be quantum 

80
00:05:44,667 --> 00:05:46,043
And two states can be super-posed

81
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:50,267
so the state of a system of the vacuum empty space 

82
00:05:51,035 --> 00:05:55,675
That's a state of no photons, the state with one photon, 

83
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:58,483
That's a state with one photon and you can add them 

84
00:05:58,779 --> 00:05:59,451
that's what's happening here,

85
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:01,875
You would eventually come to the state which is singlet 

86
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:11,947
times no photon plus one photon 

87
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:21,435
This state now is entangled between..

88
00:06:22,739 --> 00:06:24,959
Are the electrons entangled with the radiation field?

89
00:06:25,744 --> 00:06:27,447
No because it's pure product 

90
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:30,119
But are the electrons entangled with each other?

91
00:06:32,103 --> 00:06:35,139
Ya because it's singlet state, only the singlet state appears here 

92
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:37,715
And the singlet state is entangled state, 

93
00:06:38,179 --> 00:06:39,977
So electrons are entangled with each other 

94
00:06:40,177 --> 00:06:42,825
But they are not entangled with the radiation field 

95
00:06:43,714 --> 00:06:47,681
On the other hand, the radiation field is left in a superposition of states 

96
00:06:48,025 --> 00:06:50,057
of having a photon of not having a photon 

97
00:06:51,193 --> 00:06:53,289
So what do we start with?

98
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:59,151
We started with a un-entangled state of the electrons 

99
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:03,375
totally un-entangled with the radiation field 

100
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,519
I say this is an un-entangled with the electrons 

101
00:07:05,951 --> 00:07:11,023
because that's what we started with |u d> |u d>and no photon 

102
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:15,660
We started with un-entangled completely everything un-entangled 

103
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:17,997
waited for a photon to be emitted 

104
00:07:18,607 --> 00:07:22,070
when the photon was emitted the triplet state became the singlet state,

105
00:07:22,414 --> 00:07:25,052
but it emit a photon and the result was

106
00:07:26,053 --> 00:07:30,343
an entangled state of the electrons

107
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:34,231
but un-entangled with the radiation field

108
00:07:34,967 --> 00:07:38,639
okay pretty tricky set of ideas

109
00:07:39,335 --> 00:07:42,815
>> You haven't talked anything external like a magnetic field

110
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:44,887
>>So what's causing?

111
00:07:45,207 --> 00:07:49,807
No nononono, in order to, There is nothing external here

112
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:55,103
>> So what causes the triplet to emit the photon?

113
00:07:55,711 --> 00:07:58,007
>>Is it with the interaction to the other electrons

114
00:07:59,615 --> 00:08:03,903
Right, the interaction between the two electrons 

115
00:08:04,615 --> 00:08:08,655
roughly speaking each electrons in the magnetic field of another electron 

116
00:08:08,925 --> 00:08:14,385
but what they want to do was maximally anti-aligned or better yet 

117
00:08:14,657 --> 00:08:15,962
they want to minimize or make maximally negative

118
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:22,125
value of Sigma, that's tau

119
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:25,157
That's the, so they emit a photon to do that 

120
00:08:30,127 --> 00:08:36,630
Last time we start to move on to the problem of particle motion 

121
00:08:37,566 --> 00:08:38,957
Forget particle spin,

122
00:08:42,073 --> 00:08:49,926
of course real particles may have both position and spin

123
00:08:55,446 --> 00:08:57,442
but let's concentrate for today 

124
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:05,826
on questions relating to the position of particles

125
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:09,481
The simplest example we can think of 

126
00:09:09,857 --> 00:09:15,793
is a particle moving on a one-dimensional axis X there it is

127
00:09:16,897 --> 00:09:20,457
En...Before we study that I want to do a little mathematical interlude 

128
00:09:21,473 --> 00:09:23,449
It will take at most 10 minutes 

129
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:29,945
Having to do with Fourier analysis, Fourier transforms 

130
00:09:30,585 --> 00:09:33,617
and its relationship to the Dirac Delta function 

131
00:09:34,881 --> 00:09:38,497
So let's stick blackboard and do some mathematics on it

132
00:09:45,513 --> 00:09:48,065
the function e to the ipx, let's take p to be a number 

133
00:09:48,409 --> 00:09:49,961
p is a number now it's not a variable

134
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:56,022
e to the ipx, That's a combination of sine and cosine functions 

135
00:09:56,357 --> 00:10:01,113
and therefore has a wavelike character and we call it a plane wave 

136
00:10:01,329 --> 00:10:06,804
We call it a plane wave, are just the simple waves cosines and sines

137
00:10:07,236 --> 00:10:12,198
combination of cosine p dot x i sine p dot x

138
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,088
And you could think of it as a wave 

139
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,086
Of course it's not moving,

140
00:10:16,302 --> 00:10:19,174
and just e to the ipx doesn't give you any time-dependent 

141
00:10:19,462 --> 00:10:21,470
So it doesn't move, so these are wavelike 

142
00:10:22,342 --> 00:10:28,307
Okay, a very wide class of functions and certainly all the functions 

143
00:10:28,483 --> 00:10:34,968
we will be interested in can be written as sums of plane waves 

144
00:10:35,912 --> 00:10:38,976
or integrals better yet, integrals of plane waves 

145
00:10:40,008 --> 00:10:43,453
and decomposing a function in this case a function of X 

146
00:10:43,653 --> 00:10:44,365
let's call it psi of X 

147
00:10:46,189 --> 00:10:50,200
decomposing it in the plane waves is called Fourier analysis 

148
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:54,260
Now most of you know that in fact most of you 

149
00:10:54,473 --> 00:10:56,390
and some of you in any case know about Fourier analysis

150
00:10:56,558 --> 00:10:58,277
where we gonna spell it out now 

151
00:10:59,517 --> 00:11:02,933
Every function that we will be interested in,

152
00:11:04,253 --> 00:11:08,780
in fact it's probably true that that excludes almost all functions 

153
00:11:09,571 --> 00:11:12,696
but we also exclude almost all functions when we say 

154
00:11:13,015 --> 00:11:15,943
that there continuous when we say that there differentiable 

155
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:22,535
when we say that we can express them in any meaningful sensible form 

156
00:11:23,471 --> 00:11:25,784
we exclude almost all functions 

157
00:11:27,455 --> 00:11:30,863
But we take all functions to be reasonably continuous reason 

158
00:11:31,135 --> 00:11:33,023
I will not try to be very very precise 

159
00:11:34,263 --> 00:11:40,943
Continuous and the, not to blow up at infinity 

160
00:11:41,471 --> 00:11:46,720
and falls to zero at minus infinity and plus infinity 

161
00:11:47,391 --> 00:11:51,887
Almost all functions L, all functions we will be interested in 

162
00:11:52,848 --> 00:11:56,408
can be expanded in waves, 

163
00:11:56,816 --> 00:12:04,538
you know expanded means they can be written as integrals over P 

164
00:12:05,216 --> 00:12:11,104
what is P? P tells you how fast the wave oscillates 

165
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,640
this is some moderate value of p 

166
00:12:15,072 --> 00:12:19,104
if I increase P I create a wave of very short wavelength 

167
00:12:20,184 --> 00:12:23,776
decrease P I'm talking about wave with a very long wavelength 

168
00:12:25,456 --> 00:12:30,120
So this is just saying we can decompose function 

169
00:12:30,544 --> 00:12:32,776
into waves of different wavelengths 

170
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,864
each wavelength has an amplitude 

171
00:12:37,888 --> 00:12:40,600
and an amount of that wave that's in there. 

172
00:12:41,192 --> 00:12:44,976
I will call that psi twiddle of p

173
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:51,881
timese to the ipx, psi twiddle of p

174
00:12:52,690 --> 00:13:01,816
is just the amplitude that, that the wave of type P has strength psi of p

175
00:13:02,352 --> 00:13:05,120
in the functions psi of X 

176
00:13:07,064 --> 00:13:14,080
Fourier's theorem is a theorem which tells you how to reconstruct

177
00:13:15,672 --> 00:13:19,680
Psi twiddle, I'm gonna, just for definitions, really just for definition

178
00:13:20,328 --> 00:13:22,840
I'm gonna put one over square root of two pi here

179
00:13:24,456 --> 00:13:26,456
let's, that's the convention,

180
00:13:26,457 --> 00:13:29,560
we could have absorb it into Psi twiddle of p

181
00:13:32,376 --> 00:13:36,067
Psi twiddle is typically complex and so will psi of X be complex,

182
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,977
both of them might intend for the moment to the complex 

183
00:13:40,345 --> 00:13:44,240
now may happen that one of these is real and the other one is complex 

184
00:13:44,568 --> 00:13:45,994
It can happen but at the moment we just interested in 

185
00:13:45,995 --> 00:13:47,708
arbitrary complex functions

186
00:13:48,636 --> 00:13:49,756
That's right, alright the question is 

187
00:13:50,244 --> 00:13:53,748
how do you reconstruct Psi twiddle of P from psi of X ?

188
00:13:54,412 --> 00:13:58,204
and I'm going to leave it is something you can look up if you don't know it 

189
00:13:59,236 --> 00:14:01,668
It's the basic theorem of Fourier analysis 

190
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,732
that Psi twiddle of P,

191
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:13,060
notice that, psi of X is an integral over P 

192
00:14:13,364 --> 00:14:18,404
Psi twiddle of P is going to be an integral over X 

193
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:22,140
d X over square root of two pi

194
00:14:25,572 --> 00:14:33,380
times psi of X, the natural thing would be to write here e to the ipx

195
00:14:34,532 --> 00:14:36,532
but it's not particular minus ipx

196
00:14:42,868 --> 00:14:44,972
Alright two pi, Thank you 

197
00:14:47,396 --> 00:14:49,140
That's the basic theorem of Fourier analysis

198
00:14:50,676 --> 00:14:54,588
that psi of X is the Fourier transform of Psi twiddle of P,

199
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:57,595
defined in this way

200
00:14:57,931 --> 00:15:02,124
And Psi twiddle of P is a Fourier transform of psi of X 

201
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:06,852
very much the same pattern except for the e to the minus ipx there

202
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,004
We will need that theorem, so if you don't know that theorem 

203
00:15:13,487 --> 00:15:16,276
it's a very important theorem in quantum mechanics 

204
00:15:17,972 --> 00:15:21,598
and expresses a kind of reciprocal relationship between X and p 

205
00:15:23,109 --> 00:15:26,020
which, of course, ultimately are going to be position and momentum 

206
00:15:28,788 --> 00:15:32,644
Okay that's that's one little mathematical interlude 

207
00:15:32,964 --> 00:15:35,436
That maybe have to do with the Delta function 

208
00:15:36,884 --> 00:15:39,396
and then we are gonna combine them together 

209
00:15:41,964 --> 00:15:43,972
For mathematician the definition of,

210
00:15:44,468 --> 00:15:47,708
we have a, we have a intuitive definition of the Delta function 

211
00:15:48,996 --> 00:15:50,017
it's a high, narrow function, 

212
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:53,652
it's so narrow that it's width is essentially zero

213
00:15:54,756 --> 00:15:57,276
and so high that the area under it is one 

214
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:03,316
we can call that a representation of the Delta function 

215
00:16:03,628 --> 00:16:07,776
A definition of the Delta function, 

216
00:16:08,984 --> 00:16:11,140
because the Delta function is not a real function

217
00:16:11,612 --> 00:16:13,468
it's infinite somewhere but you know, 

218
00:16:13,668 --> 00:16:18,612
that's the hey no attitude about the Delta function

219
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:25,724
It took years from physicist incidentally to convince mathematicians 

220
00:16:26,348 --> 00:16:28,466
the Delta function was okay 

221
00:16:29,594 --> 00:16:32,026
that mathematicians didn't like them, for very good reason 

222
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:35,890
Their functions, they can't, you can't square them 

223
00:16:36,122 --> 00:16:40,330
They just, if you square them, they are still zero everywhere 

224
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:44,234
Except at the same point but instead of having a height of 

225
00:16:45,698 --> 00:16:47,274
Big enough to make the area one 

226
00:16:47,786 --> 00:16:49,818
they have a height which is the square of that

227
00:16:50,082 --> 00:16:53,986
So they themselves are not a, are worse objects

228
00:16:56,154 --> 00:16:58,210
but they got over it, they got over it 

229
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:02,058
And told now by some of the mathematician friends 

230
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:05,146
that it's okay to write the Delta function 

231
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,818
okay properties of the Delta function, 

232
00:17:09,682 --> 00:17:12,538
the first thing and the way a mathematician will think about it 

233
00:17:13,154 --> 00:17:15,162
is it's an operation that you can do on a function 

234
00:17:17,082 --> 00:17:21,794
In particular you can integrate any function of X 

235
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,742
any reasonable function of X 

236
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:30,250
with the Delta function Delta of X minus X prime

237
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:34,542
Oh no, let's go a step (back), let's see them go, 

238
00:17:34,543 --> 00:17:36,666
let's not even do that yet

239
00:17:39,394 --> 00:17:43,706
Let's take Delta of X minus X prime times F of X 

240
00:17:44,498 --> 00:17:51,394
First property of the Delta function is that this is equal to F of X prime 

241
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:59,058
times Delta of X minus X prime, why would that be true?

242
00:17:59,306 --> 00:18:02,482
That certainly wouldn't be true for a general function Delta

243
00:18:02,746 --> 00:18:05,887
The reason it's true is because Delta is only nonzero 

244
00:18:05,888 --> 00:18:07,458
when X is equal to X prime

245
00:18:09,058 --> 00:18:10,078
So it's no big deal,

246
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:13,346
Delta of X minus X prime is only nonzero when X equals X prime,

247
00:18:15,218 --> 00:18:18,298
and therefore it doesn't matter whether you put X or X prime 

248
00:18:18,883 --> 00:18:20,538
when multiplying it by a function 

249
00:18:21,196 --> 00:18:23,354
so that that's property number one 

250
00:18:24,706 --> 00:18:27,978
Now property number two that pretty much follows from that 

251
00:18:29,018 --> 00:18:34,914
No, not yet,property one,  property two

252
00:18:37,346 --> 00:18:44,842
Integral of Delta of X minus X prime is always equal to one 

253
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:50,066
that's just the statement that the area under this bump is equal to one 

254
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:52,186
and it doesn't matter where you put it 

255
00:18:52,562 --> 00:18:55,512
Let's put it over here, we put it over here, we put it over here, 

256
00:18:55,977 --> 00:18:57,552
the area is always equal to one, 

257
00:18:58,376 --> 00:19:02,522
and so the integral of Delta of X minus X prime,

258
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:05,922
let's say from minus infinity to infinity is always equal to one 

259
00:19:07,418 --> 00:19:11,650
And the last property which follows from these two 

260
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:26,258
is that the integral, the integral of Delta of X minus X prime, 

261
00:19:26,962 --> 00:19:36,082
F of X is equal to F of X prime, now you see it in two ways. 

262
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,578
One is that you can say look 

263
00:19:37,746 --> 00:19:40,842
The Delta function is only nonzero when X is equal to X prime 

264
00:19:41,162 --> 00:19:45,282
and so it picks out the value X prime

265
00:19:45,874 --> 00:19:49,906
or you can just say use property where is a property number one, 

266
00:19:50,306 --> 00:19:53,402
To rewrite this in the form F of X prime,

267
00:19:56,826 --> 00:20:00,851
Integral Delta of X minus X prime, d X 

268
00:20:04,859 --> 00:20:07,308
Why am I allowed to bring the F of X prime on the outside?

269
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:11,002
Because it doesn't depend on X 

270
00:20:11,315 --> 00:20:12,874
>>X prime is a constant value 

271
00:20:16,106 --> 00:20:18,314
From the point of view of, ya, that's right

272
00:20:18,739 --> 00:20:21,746
So I just bring it on the outside and then I say 

273
00:20:21,986 --> 00:20:23,586
the integral under the Delta function is one 

274
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,754
and so I just get F of X prime,

275
00:20:28,003 --> 00:20:32,826
Alright so that's the obvious properties of the Delta function 

276
00:20:33,434 --> 00:20:37,787
which you might use, the axiom applies, what a Delta function is

277
00:20:41,467 --> 00:20:45,866
Okay now I'm going to prove a theorem 

278
00:20:46,987 --> 00:20:50,922
which provides a representation of the Delta function 

279
00:20:51,579 --> 00:20:53,819
An important representation of Delta function 

280
00:20:54,371 --> 00:20:58,339
Let's, I think I can erase this for the moment 

281
00:21:02,235 --> 00:21:05,235
I may have already said that but I probably didn't

282
00:21:05,467 --> 00:21:10,173
Integral F of X Delta of X minus X prime 

283
00:21:11,099 --> 00:21:12,667
is equal to F of X prime 

284
00:21:13,235 --> 00:21:16,883
now this actually is a sufficient definition of the Delta function 

285
00:21:17,323 --> 00:21:18,651
this is the way mathematicians define it 

286
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:21,507
As an operation that you do on a function 

287
00:21:21,979 --> 00:21:23,907
that gives value of the function at some point, 

288
00:21:25,611 --> 00:21:30,107
and this is enough to define the Delta function 

289
00:21:30,563 --> 00:21:32,995
If it's not enough to define the Delta function 

290
00:21:33,395 --> 00:21:34,587
there is only one function left,

291
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:37,395
if this is true for every function F

292
00:21:37,707 --> 00:21:44,355
There is only one function only one Delta here that will fill at property

293
00:21:46,611 --> 00:21:49,315
Okay so this can be taken as the defining function 

294
00:21:49,627 --> 00:21:55,579
if for all x, this is true, than this is the Delta function 

295
00:21:56,203 --> 00:21:58,251
What's that? Yes, d X, good d X 

296
00:21:58,667 --> 00:22:07,427
Okay now what I wannado is I want to take the two top equations 

297
00:22:12,203 --> 00:22:14,595
and put them together, here's what I'm gonna do,

298
00:22:15,491 --> 00:22:19,155
I'm gonna write the psi of X is equal to this thing 

299
00:22:19,699 --> 00:22:21,099
but then you plug in for this thing,

300
00:22:23,251 --> 00:22:24,595
the second equation, 

301
00:22:24,787 --> 00:22:28,080
and re-express psi of X back in terms of the function psi of X itself 

302
00:22:31,816 --> 00:22:33,148
Let's see what we get, 

303
00:22:33,149 --> 00:22:37,233
either we will get something completely trivially stupid

304
00:22:37,977 --> 00:22:40,673
Or we will learn something, in fact we will learn something 

305
00:22:40,897 --> 00:22:42,161
So let's take psi of X and write it,

306
00:22:42,905 --> 00:22:46,345
psi of X is equal, I'm just gonna write now

307
00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:51,516
integral dP over the square root of two pi 

308
00:22:52,417 --> 00:22:58,841
e to the ipx, and now I'm going to shove in the second equation 

309
00:23:00,036 --> 00:23:03,370
the psi of psi twiddle of P, and that is

310
00:23:04,201 --> 00:23:05,657
Let's put a bra-ket around it

311
00:23:06,561 --> 00:23:08,681
d X integral, let's,

312
00:23:15,265 --> 00:23:18,081
Hold on a second, 

313
00:23:21,961 --> 00:23:25,673
Let's call it psi of X prime and to make a psi of X prime, 

314
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:27,153
all we have to do is put a prime here

315
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:31,113
Just change the name of variable on the left side 

316
00:23:31,561 --> 00:23:33,252
and to do so of course I have to change the 

317
00:23:33,253 --> 00:23:35,713
name of the variable on the right hand

318
00:23:36,121 --> 00:23:39,418
I don't want to confuse X and X prime 

319
00:23:39,842 --> 00:23:42,193
Alright now the second equation for psi twiddle of P 

320
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:44,824
that I can leave as it is, 

321
00:23:44,825 --> 00:23:48,402
and just write an integral d X over square root of two pi

322
00:23:51,790 --> 00:24:01,606
psi of x, e to the minus ipx, so just plug been psi twiddle of p

323
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:04,229
now integrals 

324
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:10,854
are generally insensitive to which order you do the integrals

325
00:24:11,974 --> 00:24:15,126
is particularly if there integrations from minus infinity to infinity 

326
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:17,110
as they are here both of them 

327
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:28,702
If they are well-defined and converged and everything 

328
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:32,030
that it doesn't matter which order you do the integrations 

329
00:24:32,462 --> 00:24:33,532
so let's start 

330
00:24:33,533 --> 00:24:38,102
let's isolate some things, let's put here integraldp over two pi

331
00:24:38,446 --> 00:24:44,430
Oh over two pi, we now have a single factor of two pi

332
00:24:45,974 --> 00:24:47,966
One coming from here one coming from here.

333
00:24:48,318 --> 00:24:55,718
Let's isolate e to the ipx prime minus X from here 

334
00:24:57,214 --> 00:25:00,254
with e to the ipx prime,e to minus ipx

335
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:05,334
That's e to the ip(Xprime minus X)

336
00:25:08,102 --> 00:25:11,830
And then we still haven't written down psi of X

337
00:25:12,246 --> 00:25:15,446
So let's write down psi of X,

338
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:21,094
And now interchange the order of integration of X and P 

339
00:25:21,481 --> 00:25:23,766
and write this as an integral d X 

340
00:25:26,934 --> 00:25:31,254
Integral d x, that's equal to psi of X prime, 

341
00:25:32,518 --> 00:25:33,279
So look what we have, 

342
00:25:34,382 --> 00:25:37,990
we have a relationship between psi of X and psi of X prime

343
00:25:38,278 --> 00:25:41,966
We have a way of writing psi of X prime in terms of psi of X 

344
00:25:43,374 --> 00:25:45,540
But what is it?but look what stands here,

345
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:53,614
Take this whole thing here, this is an integral over p, it's true

346
00:25:53,902 --> 00:25:56,318
But all it is some function of X prime minus X right?

347
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:01,254
Let's give them a name, let's call it the capital Delta function 

348
00:26:01,898 --> 00:26:04,766
Let's call this the capital Delta function write this 

349
00:26:05,406 --> 00:26:10,206
Dx, capital Delta of X prime minus X, 

350
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:16,462
It's whole messier, including the two pi and everything else 

351
00:26:16,918 --> 00:26:25,047
After integration over P times psi of X, equals psi of X prime 

352
00:26:27,431 --> 00:26:29,509
What does it tell you about this capital Delta function?

353
00:26:31,796 --> 00:26:32,932
It is just a good old Delta function, 

354
00:26:33,436 --> 00:26:35,110
it is just good old Dirac Delta function

355
00:26:35,964 --> 00:26:38,308
So we've prove an interesting relationship 

356
00:26:38,812 --> 00:26:46,055
and one that is at the heart of many many things in quantum mechanics 

357
00:26:52,381 --> 00:27:05,472
Here it is, the integral dP over two pi, e to the ip of X minus X prime 

358
00:27:07,832 --> 00:27:13,424
is equal the Delta of X minus X prime  Another words,

359
00:27:13,776 --> 00:27:16,080
it's kind of screw all the way of writing the Delta function

360
00:27:16,888 --> 00:27:23,400
by itself expressing it as a Fourier transform or a sum of plane waves 

361
00:27:26,432 --> 00:27:32,560
We can also write this, we can write, I'm writing the same thing 

362
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:37,608
I'm writing a different thing, but just like interchanging X and P

363
00:27:39,272 --> 00:27:42,608
By interchanging X and P I can write another equation 

364
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:52,352
d X over two pi, e to the ix of P minus P prime 

365
00:27:52,362 --> 00:27:55,525
equals Delta of P minus P prime 

366
00:27:56,413 --> 00:28:01,558
this is, these two are identical, these two are identical 

367
00:28:02,062 --> 00:28:06,670
I just change the name of X to P and P to X 

368
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,664
If this equation is true this equation is true 

369
00:28:10,992 --> 00:28:12,880
because there exactly the same equation 

370
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:18,112
Except that I interchange the name X with P and P with X 

371
00:28:19,608 --> 00:28:23,224
That's , so this is a, this is an important as I said 

372
00:28:26,224 --> 00:28:27,640
Fact about Delta function 

373
00:28:29,136 --> 00:28:31,523
these and the basic mathematical facts that we need 

374
00:28:33,432 --> 00:28:36,960
This here is not important, we've got a blackboard over there 

375
00:28:38,904 --> 00:28:42,840
Oh if you don't like the way I get the second one from the first one 

376
00:28:43,168 --> 00:28:44,512
By just interchanging P and X,

377
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,984
You can go back to these equations 

378
00:28:47,584 --> 00:28:50,296
and instead of eliminating psi twiddle of P 

379
00:28:51,968 --> 00:28:57,713
Eliminate psi of X by stuff substituting in psi of X from here 

380
00:28:58,072 --> 00:29:01,752
and you get, you know, you just interchange P and X 

381
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,984
good, alright, so now we have what we need 

382
00:29:06,664 --> 00:29:11,304
>> On the left hand side, you wrote X prime minus X

383
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:16,464
>> On the right board, you wrote X minus X prime

384
00:29:16,976 --> 00:29:19,592
>> Does that imply a

385
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,944
I told you it doesn't matter, it's a good question 

386
00:29:22,384 --> 00:29:26,232
It doesn't matter and the reason is Delta of X minus X prime is unchanged 

387
00:29:26,576 --> 00:29:29,120
if you interchange X and X prime 

388
00:29:29,424 --> 00:29:31,752
It's a symmetric function of its argument 

389
00:29:32,112 --> 00:29:35,504
If you interchange Delta of X minus X prime is the same as

390
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,128
Delta of X prime minus X 

391
00:29:38,338 --> 00:29:42,776
So you can check that, so the answer is it doesn't matter 

392
00:29:43,016 --> 00:29:49,536
You are probably right, I probably did the derivation systematically

393
00:29:49,856 --> 00:29:51,408
I might have got X prime minus x here

394
00:29:51,696 --> 00:29:53,944
But then in the end it does not matter

395
00:29:56,001 --> 00:30:05,449
So let's add this equation over here integral dP over two pi 

396
00:30:05,849 --> 00:30:11,048
E to the IP either X minus X prime or X prime minus X, it doesn't matter 

397
00:30:11,505 --> 00:30:13,489
is equal to Delta of X minus X prime 

398
00:30:15,225 --> 00:30:23,793
and integral dX over two pi, E to the i P minus P prime times X

399
00:30:25,841 --> 00:30:33,649
X, is equal to Delta of P minus P prime 

400
00:30:36,355 --> 00:30:39,809
Alright, now let's come back to the world of physics 

401
00:30:40,121 --> 00:30:43,137
Theworld of quantum mechanics, a particle on the line 

402
00:30:51,729 --> 00:30:53,385
If we are doing classical physics,

403
00:30:54,649 --> 00:30:56,537
we would describe the particle on the line 

404
00:30:59,417 --> 00:31:03,841
The state of the particle on a line by a point in a phase space 

405
00:31:06,433 --> 00:31:10,633
And phase space consists of a value of X and the value of P 

406
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:18,921
one of each, for a one-dimensional particle just one, one X and one P 

407
00:31:21,721 --> 00:31:22,913
what about quantum mechanics?

408
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:26,147
How do we describe the state of a quantum mechanical particle?

409
00:31:26,371 --> 00:31:26,882
Well you can try to make some guesses

410
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:32,018
Not have you to describe the state, but what can 

411
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:35,530
how do we describe an orthonormal basis of states?

412
00:31:36,506 --> 00:31:39,930
That's always is the question, give me, when you start in the new system 

413
00:31:40,402 --> 00:31:43,994
you ask what defines the space of states?

414
00:31:44,675 --> 00:31:47,466
And one way of defining the space of states is to provide 

415
00:31:47,882 --> 00:31:50,018
an orthogonal normalized basis of states 

416
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:54,938
and all states then are linear superpositions of that basis 

417
00:31:55,698 --> 00:31:57,434
Alright there are various possibilities 

418
00:31:58,866 --> 00:32:00,666
You might wonder, maybe 

419
00:32:00,954 --> 00:32:06,778
the states can be represented by the position of a particle X

420
00:32:10,172 --> 00:32:13,430
You might think maybe they can be represented by the momentum of a particle

421
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:22,320
All you might wonder might the states be represented as a pair an X and a P 

422
00:32:23,936 --> 00:32:26,392
this is large, after all in classical physics, 

423
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:32,592
it takes an X and a P to describethe position of, the state of a particle 

424
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,368
What is it in quantum mechanics?

425
00:32:35,856 --> 00:32:39,912
The answer of it in quantum mechanics is X and P are too much information

426
00:32:41,208 --> 00:32:47,696
In the same way that for the spin knowing Sigma X and Sigma y

427
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,744
Or Sigma Z and Sigma Y or whatever is too much information 

428
00:32:53,144 --> 00:32:54,840
You can't know both of them simultaneously 

429
00:32:55,392 --> 00:32:57,793
The same of course is true in quantum mechanics 

430
00:32:57,953 --> 00:32:59,113
It's actually more familiar 

431
00:32:59,649 --> 00:33:02,793
for it's called the Heisenberg uncertainty principle

432
00:33:03,688 --> 00:33:06,144
but you can't know both, So it's one or the other 

433
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,056
Classical physics,a particle has an X and P 

434
00:33:10,704 --> 00:33:14,480
In some sense in quantum mechanics a particle has an X or P 

435
00:33:15,024 --> 00:33:18,288
Meaning to say you don't try to describe it by both 

436
00:33:18,568 --> 00:33:20,224
You described it by one or the other

437
00:33:20,504 --> 00:33:22,920
We will see what the relationship is at a moment 

438
00:33:25,776 --> 00:33:30,880
So we suppose that there is an eigenvector of an observable position 

439
00:33:31,472 --> 00:33:34,064
For every value of the observable position 

440
00:33:35,024 --> 00:33:41,832
This vector represents a state in which the position of the particle 

441
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,576
is definite and at position X,

442
00:33:54,624 --> 00:33:59,072
That's an eigenvector,something which will think of as an observable X 

443
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,272
We will understandable it more mathematically in a moment 

444
00:34:04,872 --> 00:34:06,748
And like any good basis, 

445
00:34:06,749 --> 00:34:10,576
the point of a basis is to write any wave function

446
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:18,040
psi or any state vector as a superposition,

447
00:34:18,676 --> 00:34:21,936
a sum of the basis vectors,

448
00:34:23,272 --> 00:34:27,872
this is the basis vectors form a continuous range of possibilities. 

449
00:34:28,648 --> 00:34:32,912
We write it as an integral dX replacing the sum 

450
00:34:33,283 --> 00:34:42,409
and then eigenvector X times something which depends on X 

451
00:34:43,992 --> 00:34:47,152
this is completely analogous to what we've done in the past

452
00:34:47,528 --> 00:34:48,972
but we've retaken an arbitrary vector and 

453
00:34:49,347 --> 00:34:51,456
expanded in terms of eigenvectors of something 

454
00:34:52,064 --> 00:34:53,635
and these are the coefficients here 

455
00:34:53,636 --> 00:34:55,512
and we call these things the wave function

456
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:59,904
We call these things the wave function 

457
00:35:00,256 --> 00:35:07,496
In fact they are given by the inner product of the eigenvector psi 

458
00:35:08,624 --> 00:35:13,328
eigenvector X with the state psi, that is psi of X,

459
00:35:14,856 --> 00:35:18,272
this is fully analogous to what we studied in simpler systems 

460
00:35:19,432 --> 00:35:22,506
wave function is the projection of the state

461
00:35:23,104 --> 00:35:27,960
onto a state of definite X psi of X

462
00:35:29,049 --> 00:35:39,352
And secondly psi star of X times psi of X is a probability 

463
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:43,392
That the particle be found the position X 

464
00:35:44,096 --> 00:35:46,113
Now strictly speaking we talk about last time, 

465
00:35:46,392 --> 00:35:48,678
strictly speaking you have to think of it as  a particle 

466
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:49,800
as a probability density,

467
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:57,392
a probability per unit X, or a probability per unit interval of X 

468
00:35:59,219 --> 00:36:01,233
but you know you have to take that into account 

469
00:36:02,288 --> 00:36:06,184
Alright, so that's this is the basic framework of quantum mechanics 

470
00:36:06,608 --> 00:36:09,072
just being repeated except for a continuous variable 

471
00:36:10,217 --> 00:36:14,080
The inner product between two vectors X and X prime 

472
00:36:17,665 --> 00:36:21,515
is zero, unless X equals X prime,

473
00:36:23,096 --> 00:36:26,553
and if these were continuous if these with standard discrete variables 

474
00:36:26,888 --> 00:36:29,859
we would say zero unless X equals X prime 

475
00:36:30,337 --> 00:36:36,721
one if X equals X prime, we would write Kronecker Delta XX prime, 

476
00:36:37,081 --> 00:36:39,393
but X that's not helpful for continuous variables 

477
00:36:40,936 --> 00:36:43,529
for continuous variables we write the Delta function 

478
00:36:44,025 --> 00:36:47,161
Delta function Dirac Delta function, 

479
00:36:47,729 --> 00:36:51,497
it's a continuum analog of the Kronecker Delta 

480
00:37:00,881 --> 00:37:03,009
We have bra vectors and ket vectors

481
00:37:03,417 --> 00:37:07,410
If a ket vector is described by a psi of X 

482
00:37:08,065 --> 00:37:12,009
a bra vector of course would be describe in a similar way 

483
00:37:12,577 --> 00:37:14,865
in terms of psi star of X 

484
00:37:15,297 --> 00:37:25,942
so kets psi of X, wave functions bras, psi star of X

485
00:37:26,534 --> 00:37:28,262
usual thing nothing new here

486
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:34,987
Finally the inner product, not finally but the inner product 

487
00:37:35,581 --> 00:37:38,075
not between X and X prime, 

488
00:37:39,115 --> 00:37:41,963
but between two arbitrary states, 

489
00:37:42,403 --> 00:37:46,532
let's call them psi and phi,

490
00:37:48,075 --> 00:37:54,460
each one of which can be expanded by use of a wave function 

491
00:37:57,067 --> 00:38:04,819
phi is described by a wave function phi of X, the bra vector psi,

492
00:38:05,524 --> 00:38:08,659
Can you tell difference between my psi-s and my phi-s when I say it?

493
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:15,379
This is Greek phi this is Greek psi,

494
00:38:19,091 --> 00:38:21,001
but I can never say p-si, I just say psi

495
00:38:22,487 --> 00:38:24,255
I think the Greek sort of, anybody know?

496
00:38:29,336 --> 00:38:32,730
>> So is this really just a bunch of Psi-phi (sci-fi)?

497
00:38:37,208 --> 00:38:45,792
Write that down, keep that, good

498
00:38:47,768 --> 00:38:51,456
And this one is described by psi star of X 

499
00:38:53,896 --> 00:39:00,736
and if you expand them both appropriately in eigenvectors of X 

500
00:39:01,044 --> 00:39:04,800
bra vectors and Vectors,  and then use the inner product rule here 

501
00:39:05,064 --> 00:39:06,376
for the eigenvectors of X 

502
00:39:06,864 --> 00:39:10,632
you would get of course that the inner product is the integral dx

503
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:17,828
It follows by simply expanding psi expanding phi 

504
00:39:18,828 --> 00:39:20,956
And they are using this inner product here

505
00:39:21,428 --> 00:39:22,820
but it's also hardly surprising 

506
00:39:23,132 --> 00:39:28,388
the same kind of formula that we would have previously for the discrete systems 

507
00:39:30,596 --> 00:39:32,852
and last but 

508
00:39:33,964 --> 00:39:39,996
>>Question? So position and momentum is too much information 

509
00:39:41,124 --> 00:39:45,510
>>So we are certain really that just the position gives us the complete basis

510
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:50,140
>>and given anything else is just too much information 

511
00:39:50,468 --> 00:39:51,956
>>not just (position or momentum)

512
00:39:52,453 --> 00:39:53,980
>>or redundant

513
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:56,012
Yeah, pretty much everything else 

514
00:39:56,484 --> 00:40:00,764
Now the only reason I'm hesitating is because 

515
00:40:01,172 --> 00:40:02,788
we imagine a particle moving in two dimensions 

516
00:40:04,482 --> 00:40:06,386
In that case is not clear 

517
00:40:06,858 --> 00:40:09,602
you whether you can know the x coordinates of the position

518
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:11,978
And the y-coordinate of momentum for example 

519
00:40:12,322 --> 00:40:13,658
And the answer is you can 

520
00:40:14,466 --> 00:40:20,386
So but if our system was just a particle in one dimension 

521
00:40:20,682 --> 00:40:22,146
that's it 

522
00:40:22,674 --> 00:40:29,002
X and,alright, so that's a good point 

523
00:40:31,666 --> 00:40:36,066
>>So does that mean that momentum and the subjugate 

524
00:40:36,306 --> 00:40:38,626
>>can be psi

525
00:40:39,074 --> 00:40:40,168
Say that again?

526
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:43,338
>>So does that mean momentum can be treated as psi?

527
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:47,722
>>as it's expanded with an integral of x

528
00:40:48,898 --> 00:40:53,754
Yes, the Fourier transform is for, right, 

529
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:04,922
okay let's um, oh, one last thing

530
00:41:07,466 --> 00:41:12,594
The probability density, the psi star psi, notpsi star phi

531
00:41:12,916 --> 00:41:17,522
And if I integrate psi star psi with respect to X 

532
00:41:18,146 --> 00:41:20,738
that would be the inner product of psi with itself 

533
00:41:21,919 --> 00:41:25,175
and that should be equal to one on the basis that 

534
00:41:25,751 --> 00:41:27,087
the total probability should be one 

535
00:41:27,575 --> 00:41:32,967
another words nothing new again, physical state should be normalized 

536
00:41:33,663 --> 00:41:37,063
Normalized so that integral psi star psi is equal to one 

537
00:41:41,439 --> 00:41:47,607
Okay now next, last time we talk about some observables 

538
00:41:48,007 --> 00:41:49,807
The position and the momentum 

539
00:41:50,448 --> 00:41:55,923
so let's so reviewe a little bit about that, let's invent an operator,

540
00:41:56,336 --> 00:41:58,369
now capital X here 

541
00:41:58,665 --> 00:42:01,720
maybe I should, how can I indicate that it's a capital X

542
00:42:02,848 --> 00:42:08,992
let's put a line in it that makes it capital X and therefore an operator

543
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,664
as opposed to just a number or a eigenvalue 

544
00:42:12,136 --> 00:42:14,905
this is the operator or the observable 

545
00:42:16,528 --> 00:42:24,699
which whose eigenvalues or the positions of a particles the observables 

546
00:42:25,635 --> 00:42:35,395
the observable values, let's talk about the action of psi, of X

547
00:42:36,227 --> 00:42:39,659
when it hits a vector, that's what a operators do

548
00:42:39,867 --> 00:42:41,507
theyhit a vectors and they make new vectors

549
00:42:43,587 --> 00:42:46,011
I'm going to tell you what the action is 

550
00:42:46,307 --> 00:42:51,371
by telling you how it behaves in terms of wave functions 

551
00:42:51,827 --> 00:42:55,582
Instead of telling you how psi acts on a abstract vector 

552
00:42:55,918 --> 00:42:57,486
I'm going to tell you what happens 

553
00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:03,923
when the operator X hits a wave function

554
00:43:04,387 --> 00:43:07,899
Wave functions and state vectors can be thought of as a ,

555
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:10,595
one being a representation of the other

556
00:43:11,083 --> 00:43:18,683
when X hit PSI of X, what it does is just multiply psi of X by X 

557
00:43:21,971 --> 00:43:23,808
another words it gives you another function 

558
00:43:24,496 --> 00:43:27,430
that's the nature of operators they act on functions 

559
00:43:27,431 --> 00:43:29,248
to give other functions

560
00:43:29,544 --> 00:43:32,299
They act on vectors to give other vectors 

561
00:43:32,619 --> 00:43:35,652
If functions are representations

562
00:43:35,995 --> 00:43:38,667
or constructions which represent those vectors

563
00:43:38,987 --> 00:43:44,187
then whatever linear operators are 

564
00:43:44,499 --> 00:43:47,923
they should be such that the do something to the wave function 

565
00:43:48,468 --> 00:43:50,091
and this is what X does to the wave function 

566
00:43:50,531 --> 00:43:55,459
It simply multiplies it by X, it gives you new function which are 

567
00:43:56,619 --> 00:43:58,979
It's not the same functions, it's a different function, 

568
00:43:59,307 --> 00:44:01,955
but that's,that's the nature of it 

569
00:44:02,251 --> 00:44:03,089
now let's prove something 

570
00:44:03,348 --> 00:44:10,459
let's prove that the eigenvectors and the eigenvalues of this operator 

571
00:44:10,715 --> 00:44:12,107
or what we expect them to be

572
00:44:12,539 --> 00:44:15,115
You of course do expect them to be something 

573
00:44:15,507 --> 00:44:18,611
You may not realize at this moment that you expect them to be something 

574
00:44:18,803 --> 00:44:19,835
But as soon as I show you what they are, 

575
00:44:20,035 --> 00:44:20,915
you will say, yes we expected that 

576
00:44:22,507 --> 00:44:29,251
Okay so what is likely to be the eigenvector of capital X?

577
00:44:29,731 --> 00:44:31,571
Well it should be a state,

578
00:44:32,091 --> 00:44:37,790
that should be a state with a particle is localized at position X 

579
00:44:38,974 --> 00:44:41,238
In particular let's so 

580
00:44:41,622 --> 00:44:45,742
let's talk about the particle being localized at point X not

581
00:44:47,814 --> 00:44:50,766
What would we expect the eigenvector to be?

582
00:44:51,198 --> 00:44:55,070
It should be a function which is zero everywhere except that X not right?

583
00:44:55,606 --> 00:45:01,422
That's,that's what we would expected should be concentrated at X not 

584
00:45:01,894 --> 00:45:06,342
And so let's try the function Delta of X minus X not 

585
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:10,030
X not is just a parameter here now, it's a function of X 

586
00:45:10,334 --> 00:45:14,582
But it's a function of X which represents the particle at position X not 

587
00:45:16,174 --> 00:45:20,190
And let's ask the question when you operate with the operator X 

588
00:45:21,038 --> 00:45:23,078
on this wave function what do you get?

589
00:45:23,534 --> 00:45:26,310
Well the answer is, you just multiply it by little X 

590
00:45:28,086 --> 00:45:31,446
But now we go back to one of the properties of the Delta function, 

591
00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:35,414
Namely that when you multiply it by any function of X

592
00:45:35,854 --> 00:45:37,942
You could replace it by function of X prime, 

593
00:45:38,806 --> 00:45:41,812
So or in this case X not,

594
00:45:42,525 --> 00:45:47,563
this is also equal to X not times Delta of X minus X not

595
00:45:49,715 --> 00:45:51,443
But what is this equation?

596
00:45:52,035 --> 00:45:55,369
This is exactly the equation for an eigenvector of 

597
00:45:56,467 --> 00:46:02,203
an eigenvalue of the operator X, the operator X hits the wave function 

598
00:46:02,507 --> 00:46:05,345
and gives a number times the same wave function 

599
00:46:07,289 --> 00:46:10,961
the operator hits wave function gives number times wave function 

600
00:46:11,465 --> 00:46:14,361
It's clear that this is an eigenvector of the operator 

601
00:46:16,321 --> 00:46:18,225
with eigenvalue X not

602
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:24,004
So now we can make a list of the eigenvectors of various of 

603
00:46:24,308 --> 00:46:25,556
various of observables

604
00:46:26,268 --> 00:46:29,757
We are starting out list, eigenvalues and eigenvectors 

605
00:46:30,116 --> 00:46:34,916
The eigenvector associated with a particle localized the point X not

606
00:46:35,388 --> 00:46:39,772
that is equal to the Delta function of X minus X 

607
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:47,262
Exactly as you expect it right? good okay, I'm sure you did

608
00:46:49,772 --> 00:46:51,348
And that finish up x, 

609
00:46:51,948 --> 00:46:54,748
what about P what about momentum?

610
00:46:56,492 --> 00:47:03,044
Again momentum being an observable 

611
00:47:03,532 --> 00:47:06,400
you can observe if it hits you in the side of the head you feel it

612
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:15,832
You recoil, that's what momentum is, it's,  momentum

613
00:47:16,096 --> 00:47:18,928
means the same thing in quantum mechanics as in classical mechanics

614
00:47:19,224 --> 00:47:22,456
it's conserve and so if you absorb something was a momentum 

615
00:47:22,904 --> 00:47:24,872
you recoil

616
00:47:26,408 --> 00:47:28,395
Alright what was the momentum operator?

617
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:33,995
The momentum operator and we will make just ification for this 

618
00:47:34,379 --> 00:47:36,459
We will come over a little later 

619
00:47:36,716 --> 00:47:38,899
We did talk about it but I want to go back over 

620
00:47:39,403 --> 00:47:41,307
Momentum is called P

621
00:47:45,931 --> 00:47:49,109
The operator momentum

622
00:47:50,476 --> 00:47:52,652
And the operator momentum is equal to 

623
00:47:53,012 --> 00:47:54,332
there is no point beating around the bush 

624
00:47:54,508 --> 00:47:58,932
Let's say what it's equal to, it is equal to minus i,

625
00:48:00,436 --> 00:48:02,300
And I am going to put in some units here 

626
00:48:03,748 --> 00:48:06,740
Later on we will set h bar equal to one 

627
00:48:08,948 --> 00:48:12,892
It's just the choice of units but for the moment let's keep h bar there 

628
00:48:13,468 --> 00:48:17,740
times the derivative operator D

629
00:48:18,076 --> 00:48:21,828
The thing I called D last time or the operator D

630
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:28,836
The last time we studied whether capital D was Hermitian or not 

631
00:48:29,268 --> 00:48:30,732
And we found that it was not 

632
00:48:31,236 --> 00:48:36,900
but if we multiply that by i either with a ± it doesn't matter 

633
00:48:38,492 --> 00:48:43,036
If we multiply it by an i, then it becomes Hermitian

634
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:47,644
So we work that out last time if you remember that the little trick 

635
00:48:47,892 --> 00:48:48,884
with integration by parts,

636
00:48:49,324 --> 00:48:52,084
We found that D was not Hermitian

637
00:48:52,428 --> 00:48:57,236
but i times D is, so this is the definition of momentum operator 

638
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:03,204
Or it's a bunch of symbol so far 

639
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:08,668
But what is P do when it acts on a wave function?

640
00:49:09,124 --> 00:49:14,722
It just gives minus ih bar times d psi by d x

641
00:49:16,043 --> 00:49:19,691
So it's also an operator, it's also an operation 

642
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:21,794
It's an operator it's a linear operator 

643
00:49:22,058 --> 00:49:25,034
and it is a Hermitian linear operator P

644
00:49:27,042 --> 00:49:31,722
So that's what it takes to qualify as an observable in quantum mechanics 

645
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:40,750
At this point since psi is only a function of one variable 

646
00:49:41,153 --> 00:49:44,457
it doesn't matter whether I use partial derivatives 

647
00:49:44,761 --> 00:49:45,913
or just ordinary derivatives

648
00:49:46,001 --> 00:49:49,034
dlet's call them ordinary derivatives d psi by d X 

649
00:49:50,753 --> 00:49:53,525
next question what is the eigenvectors of a momentum?

650
00:49:53,886 --> 00:50:00,705
the eigenvectors of the momentum satisfy P on psi or minus I h bar 

651
00:50:01,033 --> 00:50:05,857
d psi by d X equal some eigenvalue 

652
00:50:06,089 --> 00:50:12,771
Some observable value or some possible outcome of an experiment 

653
00:50:13,049 --> 00:50:18,401
let's call it P not time psi 

654
00:50:19,897 --> 00:50:23,689
This of course P not is a number, it's a eigenvalue 

655
00:50:24,217 --> 00:50:33,961
We can let's,let's just if we get rid of the minus i here, 

656
00:50:34,241 --> 00:50:38,798
It becomes plus I on this side now we can divide it by h bar 

657
00:50:42,441 --> 00:50:45,377
Right so this is just the equation for an exponential 

658
00:50:45,729 --> 00:50:48,110
Derivative being proportional to the same function

659
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:52,502
And the solution for psi,

660
00:50:53,254 --> 00:50:58,326
it's unique apart from the multiplicative constant psi

661
00:50:59,694 --> 00:51:06,646
This is the eigenvector as a function of X 

662
00:51:07,198 --> 00:51:11,822
and let's labeled by P not, let's just label it by the fact that 

663
00:51:12,054 --> 00:51:14,790
it's the eigenvector for momentum P not 

664
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:23,198
It's a function of X and what is it?It's e to the i P not X 

665
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:37,352
Question?Oh thank you, over h bar

666
00:51:39,152 --> 00:51:41,968
Alright I just keep theh bar around for about ten more seconds,

667
00:51:42,256 --> 00:51:47,536
I just want to point out that this is a wavelike thing 

668
00:51:47,945 --> 00:51:50,336
This is a wavelike thing, it has sines and cosines 

669
00:51:50,688 --> 00:51:52,336
and it has a wavelength,

670
00:51:52,752 --> 00:51:55,856
the wavelength is the distance that you have to move 

671
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:59,080
so that the thing in the exponent changes by two pi

672
00:51:59,667 --> 00:52:02,208
Another words if we call the wavelength lambda 

673
00:52:02,521 --> 00:52:07,233
P not over h bar times lambda equals two pi

674
00:52:07,505 --> 00:52:10,721
it's a definition of the wavelength how far you have to move 

675
00:52:10,993 --> 00:52:14,417
so that the sines and cosines returned to themselves 

676
00:52:14,793 --> 00:52:22,522
or that the wavelength is two pi h bar divided by P not 

677
00:52:23,073 --> 00:52:25,569
P not being the momentum of the particle 

678
00:52:26,089 --> 00:52:30,521
so, here we see the first example of the relationship 

679
00:52:30,833 --> 00:52:33,369
between momentum and wavelength 

680
00:52:34,865 --> 00:52:37,353
Larger the momentum smaller the wavelength 

681
00:52:37,809 --> 00:52:40,273
Of course we have not yet justified 

682
00:52:40,849 --> 00:52:43,697
the choice of the terminology momentum for this thing 

683
00:52:45,209 --> 00:52:48,561
but we can keep in mind later on we are gonna come back 

684
00:52:48,977 --> 00:52:52,026
and see that this P really does behave like momentum, 

685
00:52:53,298 --> 00:52:57,018
but so far it's just an abstract observable 

686
00:52:57,290 --> 00:52:58,762
we don't know what it means yet

687
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:01,858
Okay so here we are,lambda is equal to this 

688
00:53:02,074 --> 00:53:05,378
and now that I have demonstrated that let's get rid of h bar 

689
00:53:05,626 --> 00:53:07,170
becauseI will forget about it anyway 

690
00:53:07,482 --> 00:53:11,604
let's get rid of h bar, get rid of this formula here 

691
00:53:12,108 --> 00:53:14,212
and say this is the

692
00:53:16,388 --> 00:53:19,604
now it's not clear that I have normalized this correctly

693
00:53:19,868 --> 00:53:23,020
It's not clear yet that this is normalized to one 

694
00:53:23,421 --> 00:53:29,700
Let's take the inner product between two momentum states 

695
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:35,276
This is, this here is a representation of the momentum state P not 

696
00:53:39,172 --> 00:53:44,052
Or let's just call it P, let's just call it P, get rid of the not

697
00:53:44,245 --> 00:53:47,260
It's not serving any real purpose here, P

698
00:53:47,628 --> 00:53:49,684
I think of P, just P

699
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:59,436
Let's take the inner product of two momentum states P prime and P 

700
00:54:00,564 --> 00:54:02,924
Where is our formula for inner products?

701
00:54:03,204 --> 00:54:04,084
Here it is right over here

702
00:54:05,476 --> 00:54:07,092
Alright, no, here it is over here 

703
00:54:09,124 --> 00:54:12,434
One psi star and one phi,

704
00:54:13,057 --> 00:54:16,554
so that means the inner product is the integral 

705
00:54:17,962 --> 00:54:22,498
of e to the minus i P prime X

706
00:54:22,946 --> 00:54:24,906
that's the wave function of P prime 

707
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:27,994
or the complex conjugate of it 

708
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:36,434
and then the wave function for E to the i PX dx

709
00:54:40,154 --> 00:54:48,346
Or equivalently integral E to the i P minus P prime X d X 

710
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:50,970
Now if we've done things right, 

711
00:54:51,458 --> 00:54:55,708
this P is supposed to be a observable a Hermitian operator 

712
00:54:56,068 --> 00:55:01,050
And the eigenvectors of Hermitian operators should be orthogonal 

713
00:55:01,658 --> 00:55:05,020
Then this should be zero if P is not equal to P prime,

714
00:55:07,092 --> 00:55:09,004
It's pretty clear that it is zero,

715
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:11,892
P is not equal to P prime for the following reason

716
00:55:12,396 --> 00:55:19,364
The real and imaginary parts of e to the i P minus P prime X 

717
00:55:19,644 --> 00:55:22,197
are cosines and sines,

718
00:55:22,533 --> 00:55:24,733
If P is not equal to P prime, 

719
00:55:25,341 --> 00:55:31,109
these are cosines and sines of P minus P prime X

720
00:55:31,485 --> 00:55:34,573
cosines and sines are as positive as they are negative 

721
00:55:34,959 --> 00:55:39,092
If you integrate them over a large interval you will get zero 

722
00:55:39,548 --> 00:55:42,956
As long as you pick up an integer number of wavelengths in the that's 

723
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:47,620
That's important, so as long as P is not equal to P prime 

724
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:50,569
This integral just oscillates itself to zero 

725
00:55:53,455 --> 00:55:57,905
Equally positive an equally negative for both the real and imaginary parts 

726
00:55:58,193 --> 00:55:59,457
so it is true

727
00:55:59,673 --> 00:56:04,225
P prime is not equal to, sorry P the inner product is equal to zero

728
00:56:04,449 --> 00:56:05,705
IfP is not equal to P prime 

729
00:56:06,505 --> 00:56:08,057
What about if P is equal to Pprime

730
00:56:08,369 --> 00:56:11,585
this is integral from minus infinity to infinity 

731
00:56:16,065 --> 00:56:20,777
Without looking at the other blackboard then what can we say about this?

732
00:56:21,081 --> 00:56:23,217
For P not, for P equal to P prime 

733
00:56:25,113 --> 00:56:27,249
This is gonna be infinite right?

734
00:56:27,649 --> 00:56:30,649
The integral of one integrated over all space is infinite 

735
00:56:30,906 --> 00:56:35,047
So in fact it sort of looking and smelling like it is the Delta function 

736
00:56:35,967 --> 00:56:38,127
It's smelling like it is the Delta function 

737
00:56:38,583 --> 00:56:40,790
infinite when P is equal to P prime

738
00:56:41,238 --> 00:56:43,246
And zero or otherwise it's a good thing 

739
00:56:43,798 --> 00:56:46,782
but we don't know what the actual numerical coefficient is 

740
00:56:47,126 --> 00:56:54,335
But yes we do, up here we have integral where is,

741
00:56:54,622 --> 00:57:00,310
that's this one over here integral dx over two pi 

742
00:57:05,182 --> 00:57:06,870
It's delta of P minus P prime 

743
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:13,398
The upshot of this is just that in order for this to be normalized 

744
00:57:13,742 --> 00:57:16,198
so it's inner product is a real Delta function 

745
00:57:16,910 --> 00:57:20,446
You will have to describe this divided by the square root of two 

746
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:23,397
Ya, square root of two pi, big deal 

747
00:57:24,565 --> 00:57:25,933
square root of two pi

748
00:57:26,181 --> 00:57:29,741
this is the wave function for a particle of momentum

749
00:57:33,733 --> 00:57:36,661
A particle of momentum P

750
00:57:37,277 --> 00:57:40,838
We now know what the wave functions of particles of momentum P are

751
00:57:44,671 --> 00:57:45,493
>>Question?

752
00:57:46,781 --> 00:57:51,556
>>When you are talking about two different version of P and P prime

753
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:54,821
You talked about taking the integral from minus infinity to infinity to sum

754
00:57:55,021 --> 00:57:58,037
>>in an oscillating function and you said this is zero 

755
00:57:58,269 --> 00:58:03,141
And I just trying to think in my head that normally if you do an intergral

756
00:58:03,429 --> 00:58:06,261
>>You, how do you justify that zero?

757
00:58:06,517 --> 00:58:10,637
I can see there is sort of error in zero, but I'm not sure if it's justify

758
00:58:10,829 --> 00:58:12,144
I knew somebody is gonna ask

759
00:58:18,152 --> 00:58:20,320
The answer is that you really justify it

760
00:58:21,464 --> 00:58:25,072
by starting with a theory on a finite integral

761
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,432
You are asking I think questions about convergence of the integral 

762
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,422
Integral doesn't really converge 

763
00:58:32,654 --> 00:58:37,750
So you really have to go back to some earlier starting point 

764
00:58:38,142 --> 00:58:41,118
which have I start, if I were teaching quantum mechanics 

765
00:58:41,462 --> 00:58:45,630
in graduate class of something I would have started by 

766
00:58:45,886 --> 00:58:48,406
thinking of theory on a finite integral or even better 

767
00:58:49,014 --> 00:58:52,982
on a finite periodic integral, work it out and then 

768
00:58:53,158 --> 00:58:56,910
taking carefully the limit as you let things get go to infinity 

769
00:58:58,174 --> 00:59:01,902
and then everything could be justified with rigor

770
00:59:02,208 --> 00:59:06,374
We don't have the time and so I don't do that,

771
00:59:08,822 --> 00:59:10,230
but of course 

772
00:59:10,502 --> 00:59:12,955
>>Is about the Fourier transform itself right?

773
00:59:14,101 --> 00:59:16,987
>>It's not really about quantum mechanics and physics

774
00:59:17,187 --> 00:59:20,726
It's a fact about the Fourier transform but I did cheat

775
00:59:21,990 --> 00:59:24,246
I did cheat at some point that I interchange 

776
00:59:24,502 --> 00:59:26,902
an X integration with the P integration

777
00:59:27,254 --> 00:59:29,846
And one of those integrations didn't converge 

778
00:59:30,142 --> 00:59:33,317
I did basically the same cheat that I did here 

779
00:59:37,053 --> 00:59:40,357
But you know I wouldn't cheat you 

780
00:59:41,437 --> 00:59:44,277
if I didn't know that the steps can be filled in

781
00:59:44,661 --> 00:59:45,845
and if I didn't know that

782
00:59:46,005 --> 00:59:48,773
you will go find yourself a book on Fourier transforms

783
00:59:48,973 --> 00:59:50,345
you won't be able to fill the stuff in yourself 

784
00:59:50,697 --> 00:59:53,785
so I haven't really cheated 

785
00:59:54,201 --> 00:59:57,673
what I've done was just a little bit of a short shortcut.

786
01:00:03,529 --> 01:00:08,329
Right now we've talk about the wave functions of particles with momentum P 

787
01:00:08,769 --> 01:00:11,169
but now I want to talk about a different concepts 

788
01:00:11,577 --> 01:00:15,113
The wave function in the momentum basis 

789
01:00:15,609 --> 01:00:19,034
So far all of these wave functions have been thought of 

790
01:00:19,418 --> 01:00:22,074
as functions of X

791
01:00:22,898 --> 01:00:26,290
P here is just a parameter it's the momentum of the particle.

792
01:00:27,069 --> 01:00:28,509
But the wave functions a function of x

793
01:00:29,333 --> 01:00:30,984
Oh, incidentally notice something important 

794
01:00:31,277 --> 01:00:32,581
Notice something important,

795
01:00:32,965 --> 01:00:36,349
the wave functions of particles with definite momentum 

796
01:00:36,845 --> 01:00:39,504
oscillate endlessly forever and ever 

797
01:00:39,709 --> 01:00:43,344
and they are absolutely un-localized 

798
01:00:44,525 --> 01:00:49,981
They are as de-localized as they can be and in particular psi star psi of X 

799
01:00:50,333 --> 01:00:54,919
is uniformly spread out over the entire real axis 

800
01:00:55,309 --> 01:01:01,469
In no sense is the position well-defined

801
01:01:01,726 --> 01:01:03,381
It is as uncertain as it could be 

802
01:01:04,557 --> 01:01:07,333
On the other hand, the momentum is very precise 

803
01:01:07,629 --> 01:01:09,749
This is an eigenvector and the momentum operator 

804
01:01:10,030 --> 01:01:12,405
If this were the wave function of a particle 

805
01:01:12,733 --> 01:01:15,094
and you measure it's momentum it would be P

806
01:01:15,374 --> 01:01:19,269
If you measured it's position it would be random all over the axis 

807
01:01:20,709 --> 01:01:23,445
very much well much worse than

808
01:01:23,733 --> 01:01:28,349
but very much like these Sigma X and Sigma Z representations

809
01:01:29,749 --> 01:01:33,077
where one maybe definite at the cost of the other one being

810
01:01:33,309 --> 01:01:36,957
as in-definite as possible, in that case it's just one or minus one 

811
01:01:37,357 --> 01:01:39,781
Here that's much worse, 

812
01:01:40,189 --> 01:01:48,805
So when a particle is localized in momentum 

813
01:01:49,173 --> 01:01:51,885
It's completely delocalized in position 

814
01:01:53,245 --> 01:01:54,937
We wanna be able to say we want to

815
01:01:55,329 --> 01:01:57,417
I would like to do the reciprocal thing also, 

816
01:01:57,697 --> 01:01:59,217
I like to go in the other direction 

817
01:01:59,665 --> 01:02:03,849
for that what we want to do is construct the notion called 

818
01:02:04,025 --> 01:02:06,080
the momentum spacewave function.

819
01:02:06,457 --> 01:02:10,706
The Momentum space wave function is related to the probability amplitude 

820
01:02:11,074 --> 01:02:13,732
for finding different momenta,

821
01:02:14,483 --> 01:02:16,413
so let's see if we can construct that for that 

822
01:02:16,634 --> 01:02:26,594
I think we finished it over here, alright

823
01:02:31,090 --> 01:02:34,859
We defined in general we define a wave function 

824
01:02:35,523 --> 01:02:38,179
by taking the state vector 

825
01:02:38,403 --> 01:02:41,531
and projecting it onto eigenvectors of various observables

826
01:02:41,811 --> 01:02:43,707
and that gives us the wave function 

827
01:02:43,939 --> 01:02:47,139
in the basis associated with that observables

828
01:02:48,749 --> 01:02:53,731
If I project it onto an Eigen state of X 

829
01:02:54,243 --> 01:02:56,699
that gives me the wave function psi of X 

830
01:02:57,179 --> 01:03:03,132
If instead I project it onto a state of definite momentum 

831
01:03:04,163 --> 01:03:08,723
thatgives me something I can call the wave function in the momentum basis 

832
01:03:09,475 --> 01:03:13,035
It's not a function of X so it doesn't look like a wave in space

833
01:03:14,155 --> 01:03:16,155
Doesn't look like a wave in space, 

834
01:03:16,515 --> 01:03:20,067
but it's called the wave function, and it's a function of momentum 

835
01:03:21,485 --> 01:03:26,537
What is that? Let's give it a name let's call it psi twiddle of P 

836
01:03:27,961 --> 01:03:30,771
Just of this I use the twiddle notation just to 

837
01:03:31,145 --> 01:03:35,193
remind you that it's a different thing

838
01:03:35,489 --> 01:03:39,345
a different animal from the, from the X wave function 

839
01:03:42,881 --> 01:03:44,945
How do we calculate this?

840
01:03:45,489 --> 01:03:47,337
Let's suppose we know 

841
01:03:47,721 --> 01:03:52,553
the X representation of the of the state vector psi of X

842
01:03:52,793 --> 01:03:53,705
How do we calculate this?

843
01:03:54,009 --> 01:03:59,401
Well we take the inner product of the state vector psi

844
01:03:59,873 --> 01:04:02,825
with the vector P but we know what that is

845
01:04:03,034 --> 01:04:04,313
Just the integral dx, 

846
01:04:06,737 --> 01:04:08,089
I think I've lost it, 

847
01:04:08,561 --> 01:04:17,105
Only that the only the only equation what was the psi-phi

848
01:04:19,745 --> 01:04:29,473
equals integral of psi star of X phi of X d X 

849
01:04:33,081 --> 01:04:37,193
Okay so I want the inner product between P

850
01:04:37,625 --> 01:04:40,721
Well I know the wave function of P in the position basis 

851
01:04:41,097 --> 01:04:45,729
It's just what is it? It's e to the minus i PX 

852
01:04:45,985 --> 01:04:48,473
over the square root of two pi if I remember right 

853
01:04:49,993 --> 01:04:56,249
So that's what we wrote down for psi of p of x,

854
01:04:56,449 --> 01:05:00,273
that's this guy over here, and then we have to multiply that by psi of X 

855
01:05:02,513 --> 01:05:12,217
and integrate, but that's exactly equal to psi twiddle of P

856
01:05:12,633 --> 01:05:16,825
withthe same notation that I used for Fourier transforms 

857
01:05:17,209 --> 01:05:22,833
Another words, the momentum state wave function psi twiddle of P 

858
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:28,665
is exactly the Fourier transform of the position space wave function 

859
01:05:29,121 --> 01:05:30,081
That's the upshot 

860
01:05:31,449 --> 01:05:35,834
Momentum and position are related in the same way that 

861
01:05:36,049 --> 01:05:41,641
ordinary variables positions and Fourier variables are related

862
01:05:42,026 --> 01:05:48,230
Okay so here we have, let's just call it psi twiddle of P 

863
01:05:50,336 --> 01:05:53,158
If you know what this is, if you know the wave function 

864
01:05:53,358 --> 01:05:54,502
in the position basis

865
01:05:54,670 --> 01:05:56,518
you know everything that's enough 

866
01:05:56,974 --> 01:06:00,838
In fact you can recover the wave function in the momentum basis 

867
01:06:01,174 --> 01:06:06,398
and also the probability to find the particle with different momenta 

868
01:06:06,646 --> 01:06:12,014
After all, I have abuse the notation, there shouldn't be a capital psi here

869
01:06:12,182 --> 01:06:13,838
This should be a smallpsi, it's a wave function 

870
01:06:14,126 --> 01:06:20,542
And of course the probability to measure a given value of momentum 

871
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:29,838
is just psi twiddle star of P times psi twiddle of P 

872
01:06:30,582 --> 01:06:32,550
So what do you do?

873
01:06:33,126 --> 01:06:39,174
In some way or another you know what the wave function of a particle is 

874
01:06:39,502 --> 01:06:42,750
Psi of X, but you may not be interested in measuring X

875
01:06:43,231 --> 01:06:45,238
You are interested in measuring P 

876
01:06:45,694 --> 01:06:49,990
How do you determine the various probabilities for measuring different P 

877
01:06:50,286 --> 01:06:54,902
you take that X wave function you subject that to the Fourier transform 

878
01:06:55,190 --> 01:06:57,806
You find the Fourier transform of it,

879
01:06:58,270 --> 01:07:01,836
and it's square is the probability for different momentum

880
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:05,244
This is extremely similar to going 

881
01:07:05,491 --> 01:07:08,691
from the Sigma Z basis the Sigma X basis

882
01:07:09,475 --> 01:07:14,468
Go through it and see if you can find the similarities between two 

883
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:20,102
>>So if you wanted to take a position to a momentum space

884
01:07:20,406 --> 01:07:22,470
>>it would be .. partialpartial P

885
01:07:27,343 --> 01:07:35,878
The operator P was equal to minus i d by dx

886
01:07:38,942 --> 01:07:42,742
And you apply this to a position space wave function 

887
01:07:43,174 --> 01:07:45,494
You apply it to the position space wave function 

888
01:07:46,014 --> 01:07:47,214
To find out how it acts 

889
01:07:52,294 --> 01:08:04,754
X ,not quite parallel, not minus id by dpbut plus d by dp,

890
01:08:06,738 --> 01:08:11,506
The minus sign difference has a great deal to do with this minus sign here

891
01:08:11,962 --> 01:08:13,962
And you can work it out

892
01:08:24,034 --> 01:08:27,378
>>This is the first time I've seen an explanation for Heisenberg

893
01:08:30,731 --> 01:08:34,970
>>position versus momemtum, I assume that the relation would ..

894
01:08:35,282 --> 01:08:37,666
>>in other pairs like time and energy

895
01:08:38,922 --> 01:08:40,882
The time and energy is a funny one 

896
01:08:41,338 --> 01:08:45,978
Time is not usually regarded as an operator in quantum mechanics 

897
01:08:46,274 --> 01:08:49,170
It's not usually regarded as, although you could,

898
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:55,242
You know, you do measure time, you look at your watch 

899
01:08:55,522 --> 01:09:01,794
The hand of your watch is an observable and so in that sense 

900
01:09:02,058 --> 01:09:04,714
Clock readings can be thought of as observables 

901
01:09:05,019 --> 01:09:06,922
Something a little bit funny about them 

902
01:09:07,146 --> 01:09:08,010
I don't wanna get into it for now, 

903
01:09:11,058 --> 01:09:14,970
But usually in quantum mechanics time is just consider the parameter 

904
01:09:15,186 --> 01:09:16,490
by which state evolve 

905
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:19,218
butthis is true if you have a clock for example 

906
01:09:19,626 --> 01:09:23,034
And you are interested in making that in making 

907
01:09:23,314 --> 01:09:26,866
an extremely accurate observation of the clock 

908
01:09:27,266 --> 01:09:33,290
It will be at the cost of a lack of a precision in the energy of the clock

909
01:09:34,738 --> 01:09:38,058
>>So how does Heisenberg works in field? ~

910
01:09:38,386 --> 01:09:42,426
Electrician magnetic field, just the almost anything you can think of 

911
01:09:42,730 --> 01:09:49,290
will have a conjugate variable, electric and magnetic field

912
01:09:55,386 --> 01:09:56,386
What's that? 

913
01:09:56,602 --> 01:09:57,538
>>temperature and pressure?

914
01:09:57,794 --> 01:10:01,010
No temperature and pressure are statistical mechanical variable;

915
01:10:01,274 --> 01:10:02,730
And it's not quantum mechanical variables 

916
01:10:05,274 --> 01:10:06,058
What's that?

917
01:10:06,314 --> 01:10:07,034
>>angular momentum

918
01:10:09,530 --> 01:10:12,218
Okay, the angular momentum in angle

919
01:10:13,634 --> 01:10:18,458
The angular momentum of the axial symmetric, axially symmetric system, 

920
01:10:18,770 --> 01:10:22,618
the angular momentum and the angular orientation would be another one 

921
01:10:25,386 --> 01:10:29,370
Okay there are lots of others,

922
01:10:31,082 --> 01:10:34,306
usually for example if you have some field

923
01:10:36,034 --> 01:10:42,299
Typically the field and it's time derivative are a conjugate variables 

924
01:10:42,834 --> 01:10:50,122
So there is all kinds of a, another questions?

925
01:10:50,458 --> 01:10:55,762
>>Yes, it seems like you work from a discrete state,

926
01:10:56,379 --> 01:11:01,034
>>observables of discrete states that continuous is a kind of subtle change 

927
01:11:01,314 --> 01:11:05,706
>>inrepresentation, and in that case, the discrete states, 

928
01:11:05,922 --> 01:11:07,370
>>the operators operate on the ket

929
01:11:08,250 --> 01:11:10,091
>>The wave function was just expansionary

930
01:11:10,586 --> 01:11:13,178
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but we could also

931
01:11:13,482 --> 01:11:17,578
Remember we also represent the operators as matrices 

932
01:11:18,235 --> 01:11:23,730
and thekets as columns, but a column is just a list of values

933
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:30,882
Of an amplitude as a function of where it's lying 

934
01:11:31,258 --> 01:11:33,226
How high, you know, there is a function of eigenvalue 

935
01:11:33,474 --> 01:11:35,338
So it really is the same thing 

936
01:11:37,043 --> 01:11:42,050
It is closely related to the representation of operators as matrices 

937
01:11:43,538 --> 01:11:49,459
Just the concrete, the concrete action in a particular basis 

938
01:11:50,010 --> 01:11:53,250
when you write column vectors you write them in particular basis

939
01:11:57,050 --> 01:12:00,402
Alright last remark, last remarkabout uncertainty is 

940
01:12:02,290 --> 01:12:08,573
The uncertainty principle for this particular example here 

941
01:12:09,109 --> 01:12:11,717
I'm not going to derive the uncertainty principle not today,

942
01:12:12,069 --> 01:12:13,349
if we make it to it,

943
01:12:13,581 --> 01:12:15,277
but it really is a very simple thing, 

944
01:12:15,733 --> 01:12:23,533
it is simply the statement that, it's a statement about Fourier transforms 

945
01:12:23,773 --> 01:12:27,221
and it transcends quantum mechanics 

946
01:12:27,421 --> 01:12:30,469
It's in the quantum mechanics anytime you have a pair of quantities 

947
01:12:30,717 --> 01:12:35,021
which are related by Fourier transform in this way 

948
01:12:35,373 --> 01:12:44,029
It's generally the case that the narrower one Fourier pair,

949
01:12:44,333 --> 01:12:48,280
Or half of the Fourier pair is, the broader the other one is 

950
01:12:48,743 --> 01:12:52,735
Another words the narrower range of P, 

951
01:12:53,095 --> 01:12:57,111
the broader psi of X will be and vice versa

952
01:12:57,535 --> 01:13:01,464
So I don't want to go into the a mathematical statement about the 

953
01:13:01,737 --> 01:13:04,668
about the uncertainty principle here, 

954
01:13:05,036 --> 01:13:06,276
but whatever it is,

955
01:13:06,668 --> 01:13:12,652
it really just does have to do with the character of Fourier pairs

956
01:13:13,108 --> 01:13:17,204
X and P in this case, we will come back to it I think 

957
01:13:18,645 --> 01:13:25,069
What we want to get onto was the Hamiltonian's particles 

958
01:13:25,565 --> 01:13:29,373
Just the simplest possible Hamiltonian particles 

959
01:13:29,733 --> 01:13:32,765
And how they govern the quantum mechanical evolution 

960
01:13:34,613 --> 01:13:36,727
Remember what the Hamiltonian is?

961
01:13:36,991 --> 01:13:38,455
The Hamiltonian is thing 

962
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:43,383
which first of all enters into the Schrodinger equation,

963
01:13:43,727 --> 01:13:48,343
and which also governs the time evolution of the state vector 

964
01:13:48,711 --> 01:13:54,175
Hamiltonian is to be identify with the classical idea of energy 

965
01:13:54,575 --> 01:13:57,527
Just as it is in classical mechanics,

966
01:13:59,815 --> 01:14:06,097
If we go back, we I,I discussed this earlier 

967
01:14:06,361 --> 01:14:09,017
but let's,let's 

968
01:14:10,666 --> 01:14:14,913
starting point was the idea of the unitary evolution of state vectors

969
01:14:15,345 --> 01:14:18,593
That's state vectors evolved by unitary transformation 

970
01:14:19,385 --> 01:14:23,249
And then we said well what happens if you make a tiny little 

971
01:14:23,513 --> 01:14:24,490
Tiny little change in time, 

972
01:14:24,722 --> 01:14:28,018
that should correspond to some sort of differential change 

973
01:14:28,282 --> 01:14:29,082
in the state vector

974
01:14:31,296 --> 01:14:33,199
and we found out that the differential change

975
01:14:33,471 --> 01:14:35,855
was governed by a Hermitian operator

976
01:14:36,503 --> 01:14:42,743
called the Hamiltonian, sorry if you have forgotten the details 

977
01:14:42,992 --> 01:14:45,303
I will go back to it now, not not right now, 

978
01:14:48,335 --> 01:14:50,455
but but you remember the equation 

979
01:14:51,127 --> 01:14:55,143
Equation for the evolution of the state vector 

980
01:14:55,471 --> 01:15:00,647
asi let's put our h bar in for the moment 

981
01:15:01,215 --> 01:15:02,412
Take them out again in a little while 

982
01:15:04,025 --> 01:15:06,745
d psi by dt, 

983
01:15:07,964 --> 01:15:13,108
the way the state vector we can write this in terms of state vectors

984
01:15:13,508 --> 01:15:15,924
state vector is generally a function of time 

985
01:15:16,287 --> 01:15:21,228
the state changes with time, you can take the difference between vectors 

986
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:24,420
and you can differentiate vectors with respect to time 

987
01:15:24,716 --> 01:15:27,516
if a vector happens to be time-dependent you can differentiate it

988
01:15:28,364 --> 01:15:37,100
id psi by dt is equal to the Hamiltonian operator acting on psi

989
01:15:37,572 --> 01:15:41,174
That's the time dependent Schrodinger equation 

990
01:15:41,422 --> 01:15:43,614
Wework it, I think we work out an example 

991
01:15:43,934 --> 01:15:46,742
for a spin processing in a magnetic field

992
01:15:47,598 --> 01:15:51,422
Where wejust used the Hamiltonian one of the components of the spin 

993
01:15:53,662 --> 01:15:57,262
Here is a general form of the Schrodinger equation

994
01:15:57,558 --> 01:15:58,702
The time dependent Schrodinger equation 

995
01:16:01,238 --> 01:16:03,062
And let's try out some simple Hamiltonians

996
01:16:04,238 --> 01:16:06,086
See what kind of thing you can learn from them

997
01:16:06,342 --> 01:16:11,526
I think we just study one or two, and then we will go on afterwards 

998
01:16:11,838 --> 01:16:15,566
The very simplest Hamiltonian, that I can write down 

999
01:16:16,054 --> 01:16:18,662
which is quite illustrative, nobody ever writes it down

1000
01:16:18,926 --> 01:16:20,118
But I gonna write it down anyway 

1001
01:16:24,438 --> 01:16:32,046
H now H is an operator it's not just an operator, it's a Hermitian operator

1002
01:16:32,462 --> 01:16:36,854
H doesn't stand forHermitianit stands for Hamiltonian, but never mind

1003
01:16:40,422 --> 01:16:45,926
I'm gonna try H is equal to a number, the constant,

1004
01:16:46,446 --> 01:16:48,838
C for constant, times the momentum 

1005
01:16:53,774 --> 01:16:56,190
Perfectly good thing, let's see what it does,

1006
01:16:56,846 --> 01:16:58,702
Let's see what kind of thing we learn from it 

1007
01:16:58,918 --> 01:17:02,582
Is this a reasonable Hamiltonian for a particle?

1008
01:17:03,342 --> 01:17:06,454
Ya actually it is,you will find out in a moment what kind of particle 

1009
01:17:06,958 --> 01:17:08,654
But it's not the usual thing, 

1010
01:17:08,982 --> 01:17:11,278
the usual thing we will usually write for nonrelativistic particle?

1011
01:17:11,702 --> 01:17:14,094
p squared over two m huh? 

1012
01:17:14,502 --> 01:17:15,982
Momentum squared over twice the mass

1013
01:17:16,286 --> 01:17:18,659
We will come back to that, but this is simpler

1014
01:17:19,019 --> 01:17:21,467
This is simpler and worth exploring first 

1015
01:17:21,715 --> 01:17:23,575
just to see how the apparatus works

1016
01:17:25,821 --> 01:17:28,389
Everything here should be capitalized everything,

1017
01:17:28,789 --> 01:17:29,973
'cause they are all operators

1018
01:17:32,557 --> 01:17:36,605
Okay, but how is this represented in terms of wave functions?

1019
01:17:37,421 --> 01:17:41,493
In terms of wave functions and with wave function psi of X 

1020
01:17:41,853 --> 01:17:45,053
Wave functions in the X basis and the momentum basis 

1021
01:17:46,397 --> 01:17:49,961
wave function in the X basis are just projections onto the X eigenvectors 

1022
01:17:50,598 --> 01:17:52,440
We can do that inside these equations here 

1023
01:17:55,134 --> 01:18:03,527
What this reads then, it's i h bar, d psi of X by dt

1024
01:18:05,038 --> 01:18:07,070
this is the way the wave function changes,

1025
01:18:08,208 --> 01:18:14,702
is equal, now H is C times P so let's put the C there

1026
01:18:15,070 --> 01:18:26,046
and P is minus i h bar D byd X, so there is a minus an i and h bar 

1027
01:18:26,590 --> 01:18:30,950
and a d by dx, psi of X 

1028
01:18:33,070 --> 01:18:34,302
Okay what have I done?

1029
01:18:34,686 --> 01:18:38,598
I rewritten this equation in terms of wave functions 

1030
01:18:39,150 --> 01:18:41,886
That there was the concrete representation psi of X 

1031
01:18:42,166 --> 01:18:46,470
d psi of X by dt, and I've used here the assumption that 

1032
01:18:46,710 --> 01:18:50,030
the Hamiltonian is just equal to C times the momentum 

1033
01:18:50,326 --> 01:18:54,974
and the momentum is i minus ih bar d by d X 

1034
01:18:55,630 --> 01:19:00,702
But this is of course, psi is not only a function of X

1035
01:19:00,926 --> 01:19:04,462
What is the psi the function of?Time 

1036
01:19:06,214 --> 01:19:07,022
It's a function of time 

1037
01:19:07,286 --> 01:19:09,838
because in general a state vector changes with time that's all

1038
01:19:11,894 --> 01:19:15,230
okay we can now let's cancel out the i h bars 

1039
01:19:16,806 --> 01:19:22,655
And I just get d psi by dt,

1040
01:19:25,655 --> 01:19:31,806
is equal to minus C times d psi by d X 

1041
01:19:32,406 --> 01:19:43,739
or d psi by dt plus d psi by d X with a C is equal to zero 

1042
01:19:45,931 --> 01:19:51,779
That's a pretty simple equation  In fact it's so simple that I know what

1043
01:19:52,028 --> 01:19:54,819
Not only what a was, a solution is, 

1044
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:57,940
I know all of the solutions of this equation

1045
01:19:59,572 --> 01:20:01,636
Anybody know what the solution of this equations are?

1046
01:20:02,228 --> 01:20:03,140
The general solutions?

1047
01:20:08,060 --> 01:20:11,332
A function of X minus C t

1048
01:20:13,332 --> 01:20:17,068
Any function, let's let's leave it this way 

1049
01:20:18,468 --> 01:20:23,180
Any function which is a function of X minus Ct

1050
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:28,484
Another words it doesn't depend on X and T separately 

1051
01:20:28,892 --> 01:20:31,892
It only depends on the combination X minus Ct

1052
01:20:32,252 --> 01:20:33,580
We will solve this equation 

1053
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:36,788
If I differentiate it with respect to t

1054
01:20:37,212 --> 01:20:41,324
That will be minus C times the derivative with respect to X 

1055
01:20:41,596 --> 01:20:42,900
and that's all this equation says 

1056
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:47,916
Any function of this form will solve the Schrodinger equation 

1057
01:20:49,788 --> 01:20:52,236
So let's think about a function of this form 

1058
01:20:52,596 --> 01:20:54,412
What does it do? What does it look like?

1059
01:20:57,260 --> 01:21:02,428
You can start at t equals zero cross out t here

1060
01:21:02,828 --> 01:21:04,620
with any function psi of X,

1061
01:21:06,316 --> 01:21:08,460
of course we don't want take any function 

1062
01:21:10,156 --> 01:21:13,900
I want my functions to be such that the total probability is equal to one 

1063
01:21:14,350 --> 01:21:18,644
So the integral of psi star psi should be finite equal to one 

1064
01:21:19,108 --> 01:21:24,028
They shouldn't blow up or they should be fall to zero nicely 

1065
01:21:24,324 --> 01:21:28,292
So we can integrate them ,but they could do all,

1066
01:21:28,556 --> 01:21:29,564
They can do whatever you like 

1067
01:21:33,116 --> 01:21:38,525
Some sort of lump, it can oscillate, may or may not oscillate

1068
01:21:39,652 --> 01:21:45,508
And rather general, and now we let t run

1069
01:21:46,780 --> 01:21:50,516
We let time go forward, what happens to this solution?

1070
01:21:51,084 --> 01:21:52,964
What happens to the solution is, 

1071
01:21:53,204 --> 01:21:56,155
it's stay in exactly the same solution shape

1072
01:21:56,819 --> 01:22:02,427
except every feature of it moves with a velocity C

1073
01:22:03,347 --> 01:22:09,115
The features of it moves to the right with uniform velocity C

1074
01:22:09,659 --> 01:22:13,907
That's what this function is, it's just a function which is moves rigidly 

1075
01:22:14,307 --> 01:22:17,955
without changing its shapeand of course it's a complex function

1076
01:22:18,395 --> 01:22:20,659
Sort of has a real part and an imaginary part

1077
01:22:20,907 --> 01:22:23,163
But both of them maintain exactly the same shape 

1078
01:22:23,507 --> 01:22:28,291
and they just slide down the axis uniformly with a velocity C

1079
01:22:31,235 --> 01:22:37,885
Now I chose C for a reason, it's because it's speed of light 

1080
01:22:39,069 --> 01:22:43,109
Is this a photon? Well this is not really

1081
01:22:43,557 --> 01:22:45,733
the correct description of photons,

1082
01:22:46,037 --> 01:22:49,405
but it's pretty close to the right description of neutrinos 

1083
01:22:49,645 --> 01:22:51,815
At least neutrinos which will the speed of light 

1084
01:22:59,749 --> 01:23:02,621
Real neutrinos probably move a little bit slower than the speed of light 

1085
01:23:02,885 --> 01:23:04,725
but there are un-measurably so 

1086
01:23:05,901 --> 01:23:11,781
So this would be a damn good description of one-dimensional neutrinos 

1087
01:23:12,389 --> 01:23:16,525
Except that we would have to and another possibility that they can all

1088
01:23:16,741 --> 01:23:18,861
Thisis pure right moving neutrinos

1089
01:23:19,741 --> 01:23:21,461
The pure right moving neutrinos

1090
01:23:21,709 --> 01:23:26,309
They don't have a funny thing that the energy can be

1091
01:23:26,597 --> 01:23:28,085
We are gonna come back to this, 

1092
01:23:28,541 --> 01:23:29,445
not not this quarter I think

1093
01:23:29,909 --> 01:23:31,997
But the energy can be both positive and negative

1094
01:23:32,285 --> 01:23:34,861
P is a thing which can be positive or negative

1095
01:23:35,637 --> 01:23:38,134
So this particle has the property 

1096
01:23:38,437 --> 01:23:40,637
that it can have Positive and negative energy,

1097
01:23:40,869 --> 01:23:41,677
but that's not important here 

1098
01:23:41,983 --> 01:23:43,861
is a picture of the wave function

1099
01:23:44,189 --> 01:23:46,701
moving down the axis with uniform velocity?

1100
01:23:47,437 --> 01:23:51,701
The whole probability distribution rigidly moves down the axis 

1101
01:23:51,702 --> 01:23:53,969
what happens to the expectation value of X?

1102
01:23:56,449 --> 01:23:58,353
It move the same way 

1103
01:23:58,745 --> 01:24:01,833
to the expectation value of X moves with a velocity Ct

1104
01:24:03,337 --> 01:24:07,689
and that's the quantum mechanics of the simple system. 

1105
01:24:08,137 --> 01:24:15,289
I would just point out that if we compare this with a classical mechanics 

1106
01:24:15,545 --> 01:24:19,897
of exactly the same system, Hamiltonian is equal to CP 

1107
01:24:20,361 --> 01:24:24,783
How do we compare the, how do we do the classical physics?

1108
01:24:25,423 --> 01:24:27,535
We use Hamilton's equations, 

1109
01:24:29,375 --> 01:24:34,759
so, here was mainly for this reason right here

1110
01:24:35,071 --> 01:24:38,471
that we did all quarter over classical mechanics last quarter 

1111
01:24:39,143 --> 01:24:42,055
So they are not just for this one, but for also things like this 

1112
01:24:42,975 --> 01:24:45,767
Hamilton's equations let's look at Hamilton's equations 

1113
01:24:46,104 --> 01:24:54,191
Hamilton's equations are, dH bydp equals x dot, 

1114
01:24:54,663 --> 01:25:00,399
and d H by dx equals minus P dot

1115
01:25:07,503 --> 01:25:10,423
dH by dt is just equal to C right?

1116
01:25:13,455 --> 01:25:15,831
DH by d X that's equal to zero 

1117
01:25:16,887 --> 01:25:22,607
So what this says classically is that the momentum is conserved

1118
01:25:23,079 --> 01:25:26,391
Now we will come back to the conservation of momentum in quantum mechanics

1119
01:25:27,095 --> 01:25:32,143
but it also says that the position of the particle moves with velocity C

1120
01:25:33,231 --> 01:25:38,559
In quantum mechanics the whole probability distribution in this case 

1121
01:25:39,167 --> 01:25:40,247
This is a very very simple case,

1122
01:25:40,855 --> 01:25:43,295
So the engineers just have a simpler answer 

1123
01:25:43,687 --> 01:25:46,351
The whole probability distribution moves with 

1124
01:25:46,793 --> 01:25:52,264
but in particular the expectation value of X moves with velocity C

1125
01:25:52,479 --> 01:25:56,767
so the expectation value of the position behaves according to 

1126
01:25:57,031 --> 01:25:58,343
a classical equations of motion 

1127
01:25:59,719 --> 01:26:04,295
Now that's,that's this as I said this is a very easy example 

1128
01:26:05,823 --> 01:26:12,263
which is a little bit too simple for it to be perfectly general,

1129
01:26:12,623 --> 01:26:18,258
but the, but it does illustrate the,

1130
01:26:18,858 --> 01:26:20,881
so this would be the Schrodinger equation 

1131
01:26:22,098 --> 01:26:24,706
for this very very simple Hamiltonian

1132
01:26:28,425 --> 01:26:31,290
I think we are about to,

1133
01:26:31,530 --> 01:26:33,330
Alright let's go a little more, a little more

1134
01:26:34,241 --> 01:26:38,330
And what about, andthis of course would make this a relativistic particles

1135
01:26:38,586 --> 01:26:41,602
would not be a nonrelativistic particle is a guy move the speed of light 

1136
01:26:50,794 --> 01:26:54,466
>>Without using the C just some other numbers

1137
01:26:54,698 --> 01:26:59,274
>>would this be the correct Hamiltonian 

1138
01:26:59,682 --> 01:27:02,459
>>for any particles moving in three-space?

1139
01:27:03,084 --> 01:27:05,964
No any particle which is always constrained into move 

1140
01:27:06,283 --> 01:27:08,059
with the same velocity

1141
01:27:08,355 --> 01:27:11,691
So right,right so for example,

1142
01:27:11,939 --> 01:27:18,315
You know just the photons are the quantum electromagnetic field 

1143
01:27:18,699 --> 01:27:22,659
Soundwaves and crystals also have quantum 

1144
01:27:23,067 --> 01:27:27,427
Sound waves of phonons and at least at low energies 

1145
01:27:27,635 --> 01:27:29,307
Those phonons move with uniform velocity 

1146
01:27:30,083 --> 01:27:31,819
the uniform velocity being the speed of sound 

1147
01:27:32,251 --> 01:27:35,043
so if you have a one-dimensional phonons 

1148
01:27:35,451 --> 01:27:38,171
You would describe them in a similar way 

1149
01:27:38,597 --> 01:27:41,371
>>Can you just do that, throw in a electron in three space

1150
01:27:41,595 --> 01:27:42,843
>>and it would follow that?

1151
01:27:46,963 --> 01:27:50,174
No electrons don't usually move with the speed of light 

1152
01:27:50,702 --> 01:27:51,998
>>

1153
01:27:52,206 --> 01:27:54,054
No nononono, 

1154
01:27:54,390 --> 01:28:00,414
you see this this law of physics for this particular kind of particles

1155
01:28:00,646 --> 01:28:04,102
says no matter how you throw it, with a whatever momentum you throw it with

1156
01:28:04,534 --> 01:28:06,806
it's always gonna move with in same way 

1157
01:28:09,214 --> 01:28:10,630
>>You say equation in C and 

1158
01:28:10,966 --> 01:28:12,446
With what?

1159
01:28:12,750 --> 01:28:15,846
>>You said replacing C with velocity V

1160
01:28:16,398 --> 01:28:17,958
The velocity V mean momentum 

1161
01:28:18,238 --> 01:28:20,134
>>But P V is the same as ..

1162
01:28:20,382 --> 01:28:28,238
Not quite, P square over m, but that's close, that's close

1163
01:28:28,630 --> 01:28:32,222
Alright I will do one more thing,

1164
01:28:32,510 --> 01:28:36,398
For relativistic particle of course v is not p over m, 

1165
01:28:36,727 --> 01:28:39,410
but you are on the right track yeah,

1166
01:28:39,810 --> 01:28:42,354
>>I was just imagining that any particle has a

1167
01:28:42,658 --> 01:28:45,106
wave function for it's position right?

1168
01:28:45,610 --> 01:28:49,066
>>And if it's moving in space that wave function is just moving

1169
01:28:49,410 --> 01:28:53,618
No nonono, you see that's, that's not quite right

1170
01:28:56,002 --> 01:29:00,922
Only for this very very simple situation does the wave function move 

1171
01:29:01,282 --> 01:29:04,058
with this rigid behavior and maintain a shape 

1172
01:29:05,842 --> 01:29:11,226
Not true. More generally, if you take a nonrelativistic electron 

1173
01:29:11,458 --> 01:29:13,002
We are gonna workout it's equation in 2 minutes 

1174
01:29:15,258 --> 01:29:18,722
The shape of its wave function is not maintained 

1175
01:29:19,002 --> 01:29:20,666
it sort of wobbles and does things 

1176
01:29:20,914 --> 01:29:23,858
it's sort of gradually falls apart disburses 

1177
01:29:25,818 --> 01:29:28,026
diffuses disburses, whatever you wanna call it 

1178
01:29:28,380 --> 01:29:35,306
So, Right, as I picked this one just because it's easy to solve.

1179
01:29:35,970 --> 01:29:43,290
But it doesn't represent the most general kind of motion of a particle

1180
01:29:43,730 --> 01:29:47,130
Alright so let's,let's talk about, let's take a guess 

1181
01:29:47,554 --> 01:29:50,290
Let's take a guess for nonrelativistic particle 

1182
01:29:52,210 --> 01:29:55,426
I think I already earlier showed you that 

1183
01:29:55,834 --> 01:30:03,314
the equations of motion for expectation values quantum mechanically

1184
01:30:03,618 --> 01:30:07,274
are very closely related to the corresponding equations of motion 

1185
01:30:08,346 --> 01:30:09,242
classically

1186
01:30:09,466 --> 01:30:12,810
Hamilton's equations and Poisson,Poisson bracket form of them 

1187
01:30:17,522 --> 01:30:23,119
So you can imagine that if you want to represent the quantum mechanics

1188
01:30:23,335 --> 01:30:27,783
of asystem which is a which was classical physics you know 

1189
01:30:28,192 --> 01:30:30,234
You basically use the same Hamiltonian 

1190
01:30:30,503 --> 01:30:34,266
Now we will come back to that, we will come back to justify it better

1191
01:30:34,519 --> 01:30:39,023
But the natural Hamiltonian to guess for a nonrelativistic particle 

1192
01:30:39,775 --> 01:30:42,816
is just good old p square over two m

1193
01:30:43,223 --> 01:30:45,831
This is not a particle with a force on it 

1194
01:30:46,023 --> 01:30:48,179
This is a particle of no force on it, a free particle

1195
01:30:51,211 --> 01:30:53,419
The energy the Kinetic energy T 

1196
01:30:54,787 --> 01:30:58,467
is equal to one half mass times velocity squared

1197
01:30:58,883 --> 01:31:01,569
Momentum is M times v ,

1198
01:31:02,297 --> 01:31:05,867
now we can rewrite the kinetic energy if that's all there is

1199
01:31:06,114 --> 01:31:09,777
Let's call it H is P squared over 2M 

1200
01:31:11,914 --> 01:31:14,314
So that's the Hamiltonian for a classical particle 

1201
01:31:14,889 --> 01:31:18,618
Notice this Hamiltonian has a funny feature 

1202
01:31:19,026 --> 01:31:21,506
Particles can only move to the right there were no 

1203
01:31:21,697 --> 01:31:23,521
There were no left moving motion 

1204
01:31:24,746 --> 01:31:26,434
They all only move to the right 

1205
01:31:28,889 --> 01:31:35,998
And that's a funnything, the asymmetry between left and right 

1206
01:31:36,716 --> 01:31:39,628
has to do with the fact that P goes to minus P

1207
01:31:40,070 --> 01:31:41,532
when you invert left and right

1208
01:31:42,511 --> 01:31:44,060
the Hamiltonian changes sign when this this Hamiltonian when you 

1209
01:31:44,317 --> 01:31:45,748
that's a funny thing, 

1210
01:31:46,252 --> 01:31:50,367
you would, the energy of a particle with negative momentum

1211
01:31:51,948 --> 01:31:54,844
is negative, energy of a particle positive, Momentum is positive 

1212
01:31:55,060 --> 01:31:57,892
That's a little bit weird, okay?

1213
01:31:58,524 --> 01:32:02,141
Non-ordinary nonrelativistic particle 

1214
01:32:02,428 --> 01:32:04,790
its energy is independent to which way it's moving 

1215
01:32:05,590 --> 01:32:09,279
and that's insured by the fact that the energy is proportional to p squared 

1216
01:32:09,534 --> 01:32:10,134
not P

1217
01:32:11,062 --> 01:32:15,014
so let's start with the energy being P squared over to M

1218
01:32:15,302 --> 01:32:17,761
and work out the Schrodinger equation 

1219
01:32:17,945 --> 01:32:21,345
For now we will be working out the genuine Schrodinger 

1220
01:32:21,761 --> 01:32:24,601
Well the original version of the Schrodinger equation for free particle 

1221
01:32:25,593 --> 01:32:27,905
Alright I will just write H is equal to P squared over 2M

1222
01:32:28,265 --> 01:32:36,329
H is also id by dt, now let's put h bar it just to the 

1223
01:32:36,601 --> 01:32:42,161
Schrodinger would've done it - on psi 

1224
01:32:45,265 --> 01:32:51,201
that's the left hand side thought of as an operator operating on the 

1225
01:32:51,433 --> 01:32:56,361
onthe, sorry, that's i h bar d by DT 

1226
01:32:57,129 --> 01:33:00,425
On the right hand side, Right hand side of the equation

1227
01:33:00,617 --> 01:33:01,955
It's just H acting on psi, 

1228
01:33:01,956 --> 01:33:04,161
but H is P squared over 2M 

1229
01:33:04,857 --> 01:33:06,561
So let's write that as one over 2M

1230
01:33:09,753 --> 01:33:11,257
And then what is P?

1231
01:33:11,921 --> 01:33:13,225
Whatever P is we will have to square it 

1232
01:33:13,609 --> 01:33:15,097
But let's write down what P is first 

1233
01:33:15,497 --> 01:33:20,786
Minus h bar i, i h bar, derivative with respect to X 

1234
01:33:32,690 --> 01:33:34,802
But we have to square it,

1235
01:33:35,258 --> 01:33:38,754
P squared, squaring it just means multiplying it by itself

1236
01:33:39,162 --> 01:33:42,730
so let's square this i h bar squared 

1237
01:33:43,402 --> 01:33:47,699
And then the square of the first derivative is the second derivative 

1238
01:33:48,419 --> 01:33:56,418
It means you just apply it twicetime psi or on psi of X

1239
01:33:58,514 --> 01:34:00,050
That's it, that's the Schrodinger equation 

1240
01:34:00,426 --> 01:34:05,858
For a ordinary nonrelativistic particle moving on a one-dimensional line 

1241
01:34:07,635 --> 01:34:11,579
Let's leave out the h bars, i h bar d psi by dt,

1242
01:34:13,139 --> 01:34:21,459
is equal to minus h bar squared minus comes from minus i squared over 2M 

1243
01:34:24,075 --> 01:34:27,891
d second psi by d X squared 

1244
01:34:28,643 --> 01:34:31,560
This is a kind of wave equation, incidentally, 

1245
01:34:31,776 --> 01:34:33,040
this is also a wave equation, 

1246
01:34:33,640 --> 01:34:36,368
this is a wave equation and psi is a wave function

1247
01:34:37,008 --> 01:34:40,392
this is a wave equation, psi is also a wave function

1248
01:34:41,344 --> 01:34:45,216
This is the Schrodinger equation for an ordinary nonrelativistic particle 

1249
01:34:47,458 --> 01:34:51,905
It has the property that waves of different wavelengths 

1250
01:34:52,446 --> 01:34:53,838
move with different velocities

1251
01:34:54,134 --> 01:34:57,038
I'm getting a little tired, so I wanna go over it quick so,

1252
01:34:57,278 --> 01:35:06,230
But the waves of different wavelengths move with different velocities 

1253
01:35:06,486 --> 01:35:10,558
because of that the wave function does not maintain its shape 

1254
01:35:11,542 --> 01:35:19,656
And in fact, it tends to fall apart and the, and spread 

1255
01:35:20,614 --> 01:35:23,694
wave function spreads out with time. 

1256
01:35:24,022 --> 01:35:26,358
Unlike is a very simple case over here 

1257
01:35:27,406 --> 01:35:29,447
In this case, no matter what the wavelength 

1258
01:35:29,655 --> 01:35:32,679
No matter what the momentum is they all move with same velocity

1259
01:35:33,503 --> 01:35:37,063
Not so here different momentum move with different velocities 

1260
01:35:37,735 --> 01:35:43,999
And so a wave with a given shape different parts of it 

1261
01:35:44,241 --> 01:35:45,968
will move with different velocity 

1262
01:35:46,263 --> 01:35:49,463
different wavelength different wavelengths and it will move with velocities 

1263
01:35:49,975 --> 01:35:52,255
and it will fall apart 

1264
01:35:52,671 --> 01:35:55,143
We will study it a little bit more in detail 

1265
01:35:55,535 --> 01:36:00,948
We will be studying the behavior, but I think I 

1266
01:36:02,580 --> 01:36:06,364
