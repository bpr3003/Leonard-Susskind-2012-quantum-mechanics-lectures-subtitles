1
00:00:00,455 --> 00:00:05,989
Stanford University

2
00:00:07,108 --> 00:00:10,763
Okay, tonight we are going to do a number of things

3
00:00:14,026 --> 00:00:16,580
We are going to talk about uncertainty

4
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:23,715
We are going to talk more about the Schrodinger equation

5
00:00:24,327 --> 00:00:26,316
The various version of the Schrodinger equation

6
00:00:27,143 --> 00:00:29,391
We are gonna talk about how things evolve with time 

7
00:00:29,852 --> 00:00:30,908
We've talk about that some already

8
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:34,463
Let's see what else we have here, ya

9
00:00:35,511 --> 00:00:41,299
We are gonna apply the Schrodinger equation idea to the evolution of systems

10
00:00:41,658 --> 00:00:43,336
to our favorite little system of one spin, 

11
00:00:44,261 --> 00:00:46,122
but then if we have time, and I hope we will 

12
00:00:46,972 --> 00:00:50,103
I would like to move past the single spin

13
00:00:50,694 --> 00:00:54,563
We have a general theory of quantum mechanics for which 

14
00:00:55,067 --> 00:00:59,269
I announced to what the basic rules were and the basic principles

15
00:01:00,296 --> 00:01:05,096
Hermitian operators, observables, vectors are states, and so forth and so on

16
00:01:05,468 --> 00:01:06,868
Orthogonal vectors means distinguishable 

17
00:01:07,738 --> 00:01:11,435
are very very general sets of principles

18
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:16,453
And So far we have applied it to one simple system 

19
00:01:16,956 --> 00:01:18,610
The simplest possible system in the world

20
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:19,814
We are not finished with it yet

21
00:01:21,257 --> 00:01:26,263
But hopefully tonight or next time we would move on to the next simplest

22
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,683
Well no, it's the next to next simplest system

23
00:01:31,464 --> 00:01:34,838
There is a simpler one in between, but two spins

24
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:38,026
Two spins is the next to next simplest system

25
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:42,423
Why do you think the two spins is the next to next simplest system?

26
00:01:44,339 --> 00:01:46,370
As opposed to the next simplest 

27
00:01:48,611 --> 00:01:52,328
A spin has two states, how many states do two spins have

28
00:01:52,596 --> 00:01:55,072
Two orthogonal states, four 

29
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:57,757
So what happened to the state with three states

30
00:01:58,115 --> 00:01:59,055
This is the number three state 

31
00:01:59,597 --> 00:02:02,444
You can imagine a system with three states that's the next simplest

32
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:06,433
So two spin is the next to next simplest, alright

33
00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:12,127
Let's get on, first of all the concept, 

34
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:15,367
I'm not going to do the mathematical uncertainty principal tonight, 

35
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:20,399
but we should just talk a little bit about the fact that 

36
00:02:20,851 --> 00:02:23,766
there are observables, pairs of observables 

37
00:02:24,863 --> 00:02:27,168
which can not simultaneously be measured

38
00:02:30,925 --> 00:02:36,277
The basic principal is that if you measure something 

39
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:39,989
Then by the definition of a good measurement 

40
00:02:40,755 --> 00:02:45,441
you leave the system with the same value that you measured

41
00:02:46,403 --> 00:02:48,807
Otherwise you couldn't confirm in the next round

42
00:02:49,225 --> 00:02:51,226
You couldn't confirm what you have measured 

43
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:54,542
So it's important that you leave the system at least 

44
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:59,127
momentarily or instantaneously having the same value that you measured

45
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:05,716
The measurable quantities of a system 

46
00:03:05,883 --> 00:03:09,691
are the eigenvalues of the observables operators

47
00:03:10,228 --> 00:03:12,271
The observed, the operators represent the observables 

48
00:03:12,841 --> 00:03:17,640
And the state in which the observables are definite 

49
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,973
another words in which there is no ambiguities about them

50
00:03:21,692 --> 00:03:25,408
The thing that you get after you've done a measurement of a certain quantity

51
00:03:25,902 --> 00:03:30,980
is an eigenvector or the eigenvectors of the observables

52
00:03:31,937 --> 00:03:34,480
Now supposing we have two observables 

53
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:37,573
which could be simultaneously measured

54
00:03:38,544 --> 00:03:41,978
if you measure, you could measure one

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,781
And it will leave it in the state with the same value

56
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:49,192
But you could also measure two things simultaneously

57
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:50,692
It doesn't matter, it could be one after the other

58
00:03:50,962 --> 00:03:55,464
But let's just call it simultaneously, you made two measurements simultaneously

59
00:03:55,851 --> 00:04:01,738
of two different things and you leave both of them in eigenvectors 

60
00:04:02,303 --> 00:04:04,393
of the quantities that were measured

61
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:11,196
Two distinct quantities, that must mean the state that you leave things in 

62
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:16,651
are simultaneous eigenvectors of two, of the two distinct things

63
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:19,473
If you can measure things simultaneously, 

64
00:04:20,128 --> 00:04:23,874
it means basically that they have the same eigenvectors 

65
00:04:25,104 --> 00:04:30,520
Or that there exist a complete set of basis

66
00:04:31,013 --> 00:04:36,847
basis are incidentally the term, somebody pointed out that the term basis

67
00:04:37,688 --> 00:04:41,345
That I have been misusing it a little bit, that's probably true

68
00:04:42,002 --> 00:04:47,487
I use the term basis to mean a complete set of orthonormal vectors

69
00:04:48,306 --> 00:04:49,727
You need to say the word orthogonal 

70
00:04:50,692 --> 00:04:53,015
Quantum physicist tend to use it that way

71
00:04:53,592 --> 00:04:57,918
I think in mathematics the notion of the basis 

72
00:04:58,517 --> 00:05:00,659
does not requires the vectors be orthogonal

73
00:05:01,409 --> 00:05:04,526
It just requires them to be linearly independent 

74
00:05:05,432 --> 00:05:07,707
Alright that's not a big deal, I just point it out for you 

75
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,755
I will use the term basis to mean 

76
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:14,008
a complete set of orthogonal normalized vectors

77
00:05:16,884 --> 00:05:24,862
The eigenvectors of an observable can be made

78
00:05:25,342 --> 00:05:27,628
to be complete orthonormal basis

79
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:31,569
when I see It can be make to be, you do have ambiguity

80
00:05:32,345 --> 00:05:36,101
What happens if there are two eigenvalues with exactly the same value

81
00:05:36,684 --> 00:05:41,001
Then you have the ambiguity, you have to choose eigenvectors

82
00:05:41,253 --> 00:05:42,684
But you can't choose them perpendicular

83
00:05:44,907 --> 00:05:48,862
And if you have two distinct operators which can be simultaneously measured

84
00:05:49,539 --> 00:05:55,732
and therefore simultaneously left an eigenvector of those quantities

85
00:05:56,292 --> 00:06:00,903
It must mean that there is a basis, 

86
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:06,168
a basis of vectors which are simultaneous eigenvectors of both quantities

87
00:06:07,288 --> 00:06:10,653
Another words, there exist a basis if, 

88
00:06:11,429 --> 00:06:15,400
Let's call the two observables L and M

89
00:06:16,733 --> 00:06:20,079
These are Hermitian operators, L and M

90
00:06:20,621 --> 00:06:25,636
And it means that if L and M are to be simultaneously measurable 

91
00:06:26,193 --> 00:06:28,242
It must mean that there is a complete basis

92
00:06:29,143 --> 00:06:34,268
basis of states, which are both simultaneously eigenvectors of L

93
00:06:34,524 --> 00:06:35,481
and eigenvector of M

94
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:40,739
So that must mean that L on |i> equals

95
00:06:41,353 --> 00:06:46,511
Let's use the notation for eigenvalues of L 

96
00:06:47,655 --> 00:06:54,491
Let's use the notation little l, little l sub i, instead of lambda

97
00:06:55,018 --> 00:07:02,211
l sub i times |i>, that's the condition that |i> be an eigenvector of L

98
00:07:02,557 --> 00:07:03,878
with eigenvalue l sub i

99
00:07:04,642 --> 00:07:07,636
and at the same time the same set of state 

100
00:07:08,123 --> 00:07:12,900
must be eigenvectors of the m observable

101
00:07:15,012 --> 00:07:18,592
so this must be true for a complete set of states

102
00:07:19,858 --> 00:07:24,729
Now let's apply L and M in sequence

103
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:28,962
First L and then M, and then try the other way

104
00:07:29,681 --> 00:07:30,293
And see what we get

105
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,313
So first, let's start on L on |i>, here we have it

106
00:07:36,192 --> 00:07:46,235
But now let's take M multiplied by L and then hit the eigenvector |i>

107
00:07:46,961 --> 00:07:55,601
Well from the first relationship here this is equal to M times l sub i times |i>

108
00:07:56,902 --> 00:07:58,888
All I've down is plug in the first equation

109
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:02,287
But now l sub i, that's just number, that's a number

110
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,964
That's not even a matrix, it's just good old number, an eigenvalue

111
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:10,634
And that means we can write it as l sub i M times |i>

112
00:08:13,912 --> 00:08:16,779
But now we know that M times |i> is just a little m

113
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:23,502
So what does this give, so this give us l sub i, m sub i times |i>

114
00:08:24,133 --> 00:08:27,641
A product, okay that's not too surprising

115
00:08:28,481 --> 00:08:31,744
|i> is a thing which can be measured, oh sorry

116
00:08:32,068 --> 00:08:35,271
M and L are things can both be measured simultaneously

117
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:41,033
And if we multiply the two of them together as matrices, or as operators

118
00:08:41,758 --> 00:08:45,219
They become another observable whose eigenvalues are just a product

119
00:08:46,488 --> 00:08:50,080
But if we did it in exactly in the opposite order 

120
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,049
LM on |i> we will get exactly the same thing

121
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:57,697
The order, these are just numbers, 

122
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,425
so that the order you write them down doesn't matter, 

123
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:04,553
l sub i times m sub i is the same as m sub i times l sub i

124
00:09:05,806 --> 00:09:10,250
and so this is equal to the same thing, same thing

125
00:09:12,256 --> 00:09:16,975
Now supposing you have two operators

126
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:24,078
which have exactly the same action on every member of a basis

127
00:09:25,514 --> 00:09:30,316
That means they would have the same action on any superposition of vectors

128
00:09:31,877 --> 00:09:33,901
Formed out of the superposition of base vectors 

129
00:09:34,689 --> 00:09:38,250
Another words, they would have the same action on any vectors 

130
00:09:38,885 --> 00:09:45,085
M times L and L times M have exactly the same action on any vector

131
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:49,911
And therefore M times L is equal to L times M, it's operators

132
00:09:51,081 --> 00:09:53,192
So we prove the following theorems

133
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,303
That if two things are simultaneously measureable 

134
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:01,645
The two observables or the 

135
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:05,523
two operators representing those observables commute

136
00:10:06,501 --> 00:10:08,683
L times M and M times L are the same 

137
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:14,253
Or L time M minus M times L which is the commutator 

138
00:10:14,498 --> 00:10:22,257
Which is the commutator [L,M] must be equal to zero

139
00:10:23,726 --> 00:10:28,704
You can prove a stronger form of this theorem

140
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:30,473
And it just go the other way

141
00:10:31,014 --> 00:10:33,319
If you have two operators, I will leave these to you

142
00:10:33,827 --> 00:10:35,594
If you have two operators which commute

143
00:10:36,587 --> 00:10:40,462
Remember if you have two operators which commute

144
00:10:40,991 --> 00:10:44,068
It means that you can find a complete basis of state

145
00:10:44,937 --> 00:10:47,218
in which both of them simultaneously

146
00:10:48,294 --> 00:10:51,148
in which the complete basis of state 

147
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:54,889
are simultaneous eigenvectors of the two operators

148
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,402
As it goes, both ways, given that you have two things 

149
00:10:59,924 --> 00:11:01,444
which can simultaneously be measured

150
00:11:02,911 --> 00:11:05,410
If follows that they commute, and if two things commute

151
00:11:06,161 --> 00:11:08,379
It follows that they can simultaneously measure

152
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:11,357
They have complete set of common eigenvectors

153
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,260
So the condition then for things to be simultaneously measurable 

154
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,660
is that they commute, 

155
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,456
What if they don't commute?

156
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:26,972
In fact we already have some examples that things don't commute 

157
00:11:27,758 --> 00:11:32,522
Sigma x and sigma y and sigma z, no two of them commute

158
00:11:33,506 --> 00:11:35,669
No two of them commute with each other 

159
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:40,846
And therefore they do not have simultaneous eigenvectors 

160
00:11:41,319 --> 00:11:45,656
That's no surprise, we know that the eigenvector of sigma z are up and down

161
00:11:46,191 --> 00:11:50,096
The eigenvector of sigma x or left and right they are the same thing

162
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:55,402
They are different, they don't, they are not proportional to each other

163
00:11:56,933 --> 00:11:59,958
So there are examples of operators which don't commute

164
00:12:00,736 --> 00:12:03,593
In fact we are gonna work out the commutation relation for them

165
00:12:04,104 --> 00:12:05,927
They don't commute, in fact they don't commute 

166
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:09,224
And that's an indication that you can not measure them simultaneously

167
00:12:10,191 --> 00:12:14,475
That's the idea of uncertainty, the idea of uncertainty is 

168
00:12:14,848 --> 00:12:19,073
when you have two objects, two observables

169
00:12:19,704 --> 00:12:21,484
Each of which you could decide to measure

170
00:12:22,718 --> 00:12:26,919
And get the answer, you may not know what the answer is gonna be

171
00:12:27,444 --> 00:12:30,249
It's statistical, but you can't measure them

172
00:12:30,701 --> 00:12:33,638
After you measure them, be certain you can repeat the measurement

173
00:12:34,278 --> 00:12:37,372
and find the consistency, each of them, but not both of them

174
00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:41,509
In classical physics there is no such thing

175
00:12:41,804 --> 00:12:43,377
If you can measure A and you can measure B

176
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:45,072
Then you can measure both A and B 

177
00:12:46,696 --> 00:12:48,565
And you can be certain about both of them 

178
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:50,469
If you can be certain about either of them

179
00:12:52,131 --> 00:12:55,887
So that's just, and we will come back to that uncertainty

180
00:12:56,284 --> 00:13:05,114
And quantify it, um, there maybe states where although you,

181
00:13:05,264 --> 00:13:10,500
Alright, we will come back to it

182
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:18,401
We want to quantitate a measure of the necessary degree of uncertainty

183
00:13:19,484 --> 00:13:22,709
In measuring two things simultaneously, that's the uncertainty principle

184
00:13:23,145 --> 00:13:25,971
But for the moment we have the idea and an explanation of 

185
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:31,227
why there are uncertainties between observables in the first place 

186
00:13:33,227 --> 00:13:43,178
>> (inaudible) why they have to share

187
00:13:43,185 --> 00:13:47,564
Well if you measure them, and you get answers for both of them 

188
00:13:48,908 --> 00:13:52,267
You have to leave the system in a state which an eigenvector 

189
00:13:52,671 --> 00:13:54,204
Either one of them, both of them

190
00:13:54,989 --> 00:13:57,054
That's the rule, and when you measure something 

191
00:13:57,867 --> 00:14:01,236
It leaves it in a state of definite wetness

192
00:14:01,734 --> 00:14:04,371
whatever that happens to be, which means an eigenvector

193
00:14:05,115 --> 00:14:09,299
If you measure two things, if you can measure two things simultaneously

194
00:14:10,142 --> 00:14:13,639
It must mean the state you leave it in is an eigenvector of both of them

195
00:14:15,265 --> 00:14:16,279
Okay

196
00:14:18,413 --> 00:14:28,927
Alright, let's come back now to the evolution of systems

197
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:37,381
As I said last time, I went back and look at the classical mechanics notes

198
00:14:37,917 --> 00:14:45,148
And I realized that, and I have something like a fifty pages of quantum notes

199
00:14:46,357 --> 00:14:50,930
The equivalent classically was how many pages in classical mechanics

200
00:14:51,393 --> 00:14:54,256
A half, about a quarter of pages, just the statement 

201
00:14:54,668 --> 00:14:59,251
that states of a set of things you can write on the blackboard

202
00:14:59,672 --> 00:15:04,549
So fifty pages to get to where classical mechanics

203
00:15:05,027 --> 00:15:11,209
After about thirty seconds, and it is just the way it is

204
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,385
The next thing we did when we talk about classical mechanics

205
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,208
We talk about the state change with time

206
00:15:16,561 --> 00:15:18,033
That took another page 

207
00:15:18,845 --> 00:15:21,196
Arrows going from one to the next so forth

208
00:15:22,962 --> 00:15:26,858
Here is not so bad, it ain't gonna take us another 50 pages fortunately

209
00:15:27,488 --> 00:15:29,028
In fact we have already lay it out

210
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:33,976
It took basically, I would say something like about five pages 

211
00:15:34,215 --> 00:15:37,131
Something in my notes, I think four or five pages, maybe a little more

212
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:43,497
So we are beginning to compress, and things are

213
00:15:44,145 --> 00:15:48,283
Once you get the idea of state, the next is a little bit easier 

214
00:15:49,138 --> 00:15:54,162
Okay, so let's remind ourselves what we said about the time evolution

215
00:15:54,969 --> 00:15:55,900
The Schrodinger equation, 

216
00:15:56,381 --> 00:15:59,806
the Schrodinger equation is the equation that governs the time evolution of systems

217
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:05,711
We began with the idea of conservation of distinction

218
00:16:06,354 --> 00:16:08,265
Or conservation of distinguishability of states 

219
00:16:09,406 --> 00:16:13,928
The implications was the state which are orthogonal remain orthogonal

220
00:16:15,276 --> 00:16:18,394
It was easy to prove from that, and I hope you've proved it

221
00:16:19,406 --> 00:16:26,241
You should be able to prove it, that the U operator

222
00:16:30,064 --> 00:16:32,587
I should have brought my own pens

223
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,705
The U operator, remember what the U operator is 

224
00:16:38,075 --> 00:16:44,447
If you want to know what a state is at a later time from a value at time zero

225
00:16:45,148 --> 00:16:46,204
It stands for time zero

226
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:51,218
Then you apply a certain operation

227
00:16:52,921 --> 00:16:55,900
It's more than just an operation, it's a linear operator

228
00:16:57,329 --> 00:17:01,755
A linear operator U, and you get Psi at time t

229
00:17:03,808 --> 00:17:06,551
U of course is a function of t

230
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:11,974
At later or the earlier if you want to project the vector forward

231
00:17:12,825 --> 00:17:14,065
You put in different t-s here

232
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:16,079
And that was the basic equation 

233
00:17:17,852 --> 00:17:19,969
But then we require another ingredient 

234
00:17:20,327 --> 00:17:23,535
Another ingredient is that orthogonal states stay orthogonal

235
00:17:24,347 --> 00:17:28,480
So for example if we have two orthogonal states

236
00:17:29,344 --> 00:17:31,715
Let's call them for the moment i and j instead of Psi

237
00:17:32,867 --> 00:17:36,402
i and j are orthogonal

238
00:17:37,487 --> 00:17:41,177
In fact i and j might be members of an orthonormal basis

239
00:17:42,818 --> 00:17:44,931
Let's take them to be members of an orthonormal basis

240
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:48,435
And then you allow |i> to evolve for a time

241
00:17:48,827 --> 00:17:50,442
And you allow <j| to evolve for a time

242
00:17:51,639 --> 00:17:58,347
The ket vector |i> becomes U, let's say U of t, times |i>

243
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:02,576
If you start with |i>, after a time it's U of t of |i>

244
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:09,458
<j| evolves with the Hermitian conjugate of U, <j

|245
00:18:11,414 --> 00:18:18,136
And the assumption is that if |i> and <j| were orthonormal

246
00:18:19,607 --> 00:18:24,179
U times |i> and U star times <j| are also orthonormal

247
00:18:26,351 --> 00:18:31,021
So the way to say this is if <j|i> is equal to a Kronecker delta

248
00:18:32,598 --> 00:18:35,546
Then this is also equal to a Kronecker delta

249
00:18:39,261 --> 00:18:41,638
Another words, putting U and U dagger, 

250
00:18:42,138 --> 00:18:44,941
sandwiching them between orthonormal basis here

251
00:18:45,405 --> 00:18:48,892
does not change the inner product, and from that you can conclude

252
00:18:49,736 --> 00:18:51,939
Since this is true for any member of the basis 

253
00:18:52,956 --> 00:18:58,182
That U dagger U is just a unit operator

254
00:18:59,002 --> 00:19:01,615
We did this last time, I know, unit operator

255
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,629
It does nothing, U dagger times U

256
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,843
Then we went on to another step

257
00:19:08,373 --> 00:19:12,874
You said, aye, let's consider the evolution from time zero 

258
00:19:13,389 --> 00:19:15,818
to an infinitesimally short time later

259
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:20,494
So we are interested in let's call it U of epsilon

260
00:19:21,847 --> 00:19:23,134
Where epsilon is a small time 

261
00:19:24,472 --> 00:19:28,466
And we argue, well first of all if epsilon was zero nothing happens

262
00:19:30,033 --> 00:19:35,794
And say that nothing happens means that U is the unit operator

263
00:19:36,832 --> 00:19:39,895
Alright so U of zero is just a unit operator, it does nothing

264
00:19:40,117 --> 00:19:41,105
Just leave it to stay the same 

265
00:19:42,334 --> 00:19:45,487
We added one more thing, and that was a kind of continuity

266
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:47,320
I may not have spell it out

267
00:19:47,629 --> 00:19:53,843
A kind of continuity and that was that U of a small time is close to the identity

268
00:19:55,466 --> 00:19:57,221
Another words in a very small period of time 

269
00:19:57,442 --> 00:19:58,491
And the state doesn't change much

270
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,481
So that's the same as saying that U is equal to the unit operator 

271
00:20:06,161 --> 00:20:09,842
plus something small of order epsilon

272
00:20:11,448 --> 00:20:14,475
And I used my freedom of definition

273
00:20:15,037 --> 00:20:21,577
Just choosing definitions to write this as minus i epsilon times H

274
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:26,025
There was no content in that minus i times epsilon

275
00:20:27,118 --> 00:20:28,825
I can just absorb it into H

276
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:33,311
I put it there in fact, had I really wanted to keep track of 

277
00:20:33,618 --> 00:20:35,042
all the interesting constants

278
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,896
I would have put an h bar over here

279
00:20:40,495 --> 00:20:42,656
But this is all a matter of convention 

280
00:20:44,188 --> 00:20:47,417
Whether or not we include H bar, whether or not we include an i

281
00:20:47,869 --> 00:20:48,908
Whether or not we include an epsilon

282
00:20:49,425 --> 00:20:54,907
Is simply a definition of how, of H 

283
00:20:55,795 --> 00:20:57,734
We could have call this the whole thing K

284
00:20:58,692 --> 00:21:01,946
And then said K is equal to i epsilon H, you know what I mean

285
00:21:02,307 --> 00:21:03,381
I don't have to say it any more

286
00:21:03,798 --> 00:21:06,748
Alright let's take away the H, and h bar and forget it anyway

287
00:21:08,661 --> 00:21:10,192
It's unit, it's simply unit

288
00:21:13,745 --> 00:21:19,223
We fit this, let's write another one U dagger of epsilon

289
00:21:20,047 --> 00:21:24,533
is equal to one plus i epsilon H dagger

290
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,166
Dagger meaning Hermitian conjugate

291
00:21:27,874 --> 00:21:32,126
Then we feed these two into the unitarity condition

292
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:38,954
And what do we find? We found that H minus H dagger must be equal to zero

293
00:21:40,917 --> 00:21:44,548
That's what happen if you feed these two into the unitarity condition

294
00:21:44,774 --> 00:21:48,527
Or another way to say it, is H is equal to H dagger

295
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,922
Or H is Hermitian

296
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:54,264
Now that's big news, why is that big news?

297
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,770
It means that H is an observable

298
00:21:57,702 --> 00:21:59,366
It's something that we can measure

299
00:21:59,848 --> 00:22:01,889
And we should be interested in it

300
00:22:02,414 --> 00:22:03,042
What it is?

301
00:22:03,581 --> 00:22:05,706
And of course the answer is, it's the not of course

302
00:22:06,228 --> 00:22:08,647
But as I said last time, it's essentially 

303
00:22:08,816 --> 00:22:11,534
It is apart from the fact that Planck's constant 

304
00:22:11,754 --> 00:22:16,045
It is the Hamiltonian, what's it got to do with classical Hamiltonian?

305
00:22:16,475 --> 00:22:18,731
We've talked about it a little bit, I will come back to it

306
00:22:19,045 --> 00:22:22,571
But for the moment, it's just called the quantum mechanically Hamiltonian

307
00:22:23,402 --> 00:22:27,070
It's a thing which in some way or another, not in a very clear way

308
00:22:27,373 --> 00:22:30,320
generates time evolution

309
00:22:34,849 --> 00:22:37,702
Incidentally you might think of this, alright, let's go on

310
00:22:37,975 --> 00:22:39,500
We've run a little bit another step

311
00:22:39,863 --> 00:22:46,737
It's okay let's write the equation, Psi of epsilon as purely viewed

312
00:22:47,012 --> 00:22:57,752
Psi of epsilon is equal to Psi of zero minus i epsilon H Psi of zero

313
00:23:00,494 --> 00:23:02,676
I just plug in for what U is

314
00:23:05,285 --> 00:23:10,266
And then let's transpose the left hand side and divided by epsilon

315
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,879
Transposing to the left hand side make this the minus 

316
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:18,940
Makes an equal sign here, and then divided by epsilon

317
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:25,386
It's the obvious thing to do

318
00:23:26,967 --> 00:23:28,176
And what do we get on the left?

319
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:32,419
We get the time derivative of the state vector of the system

320
00:23:33,399 --> 00:23:35,455
The time derivative of the state vector of the system

321
00:23:37,358 --> 00:23:46,521
D Psi by D t is equal to minus i H Psi

322
00:23:47,223 --> 00:23:52,395
So what H is, it's a rule for how you update the state of a system

323
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:56,912
If you know it at an instance of time then in the next instance of time

324
00:23:57,551 --> 00:24:02,632
It's you make an incremental change in the state of a system 

325
00:24:03,104 --> 00:24:05,761
proportional to minus i H which times |Psi>

326
00:24:06,658 --> 00:24:09,796
It's a little machine for telling you how you update the state of system

327
00:24:10,285 --> 00:24:11,340
That sounds awfully deterministic, 

328
00:24:12,348 --> 00:24:13,989
it sounds awfully much like classical determinism

329
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:24,151
Classical determinism is also a set of rule for updating the state of the system

330
00:24:25,557 --> 00:24:28,009
So in what sense the thing is not deterministic?

331
00:24:28,703 --> 00:24:31,525
If you know how to change the state from one instance of time to another

332
00:24:31,922 --> 00:24:33,614
We are not deterministic in the sense that 

333
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:36,272
even if you know the state of the system

334
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,755
You simply don't know the result of every measurement 

335
00:24:41,818 --> 00:24:45,440
The knowledge of the state of a system in quantum mechanics

336
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:52,633
is not equivalent to the knowledge of the outcome of every experiment

337
00:24:54,894 --> 00:24:56,666
What does it tell you the state of the system?

338
00:24:56,934 --> 00:24:59,039
It tells you the probabilities

339
00:24:59,571 --> 00:25:03,020
So this is basically a rule for updating probabilities

340
00:25:03,808 --> 00:25:09,806
It's not a rule for updating knowledge, complete knowledge of the state of the

341
00:25:10,097 --> 00:25:13,254
set of the experiment you could do

342
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:19,964
But in some sense or another, the state vector evolves

343
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,793
I don't want to call it deterministically

344
00:25:23,194 --> 00:25:25,730
Because deterministically carries a package with it

345
00:25:26,521 --> 00:25:30,422
But it evolves in a known and definite way

346
00:25:30,709 --> 00:25:34,186
Now this is true but only if you don't interfere with the system

347
00:25:35,173 --> 00:25:39,341
In classical mechanics you can interfere with a system arbitrarily gently

348
00:25:39,884 --> 00:25:43,813
And not cause the, cause any changes in the way it is evolving 

349
00:25:44,939 --> 00:25:47,397
In quantum mechanics when you make a measurement 

350
00:25:47,955 --> 00:25:49,518
You necessarily disturb a system

351
00:25:50,313 --> 00:25:55,777
So this is the evolution of the system of an undisturbed system that is not

352
00:25:56,047 --> 00:25:57,196
in the process of being measure

353
00:25:58,485 --> 00:25:59,983
>> What if the system happens to be 

354
00:26:00,289 --> 00:26:02,341
>> in eigen state when the measurement is made

355
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,116
Sorry, so what? 

356
00:26:04,591 --> 00:26:06,545
>> And you would not disturb a system

357
00:26:07,283 --> 00:26:09,181
Well that's a special case, ya

358
00:26:09,532 --> 00:26:13,153
You are right, you are right, that is if you, that's right

359
00:26:13,674 --> 00:26:17,100
If it's in a special case of an eigen state of a system when you measure it

360
00:26:17,585 --> 00:26:18,363
It doesn't disturb it

361
00:26:19,332 --> 00:26:25,224
So right, so that is an exception to what I said

362
00:26:26,023 --> 00:26:30,717
But generally speaking, the generic situation is when you measure something

363
00:26:31,436 --> 00:26:33,449
You disturb something else about the system

364
00:26:39,747 --> 00:26:43,639
This equation is the Schrodinger equation

365
00:26:44,878 --> 00:26:50,144
Now it's sometimes call the generalized Schrodinger equation

366
00:26:51,761 --> 00:26:55,663
The actual equation Schrodinger wrote down was a particular kind of a system

367
00:26:56,037 --> 00:26:56,969
The motion of a particle 

368
00:26:58,224 --> 00:27:00,938
But has exactly this form 

369
00:27:02,859 --> 00:27:06,455
This first became known as the generalized Schrodinger equation 

370
00:27:06,864 --> 00:27:09,009
And people drop the generalized, 

371
00:27:10,183 --> 00:27:13,268
we now think of this as a form of the Schrodinger equation

372
00:27:13,942 --> 00:27:17,473
And what it is? It's an equation which tell us how state change with time

373
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:22,079
It can be applied to the simplest system of a single spin

374
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:26,410
It can be applied to the second simplest and the third simplest system

375
00:27:26,971 --> 00:27:28,989
And to system with arbitrarily complexity

376
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,082
This is the form that it has

377
00:27:32,811 --> 00:27:38,716
Alright, that's, that's where we more or less work last time

378
00:27:39,403 --> 00:27:42,323
Okay, let's erase everything but the Schrodinger equation

379
00:27:46,404 --> 00:27:49,870
Actually this is called the time dependent Schrodinger equation

380
00:27:50,963 --> 00:27:53,596
The time dependent Schrodinger equation is an equation 

381
00:27:54,085 --> 00:27:55,712
for how things change with time

382
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,580
There is also another equation 

383
00:27:58,922 --> 00:28:00,420
which is called the time independent Schrodinger equation

384
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:06,847
H is an observable, it correspond to the Hamiltonian, but

385
00:28:07,131 --> 00:28:10,715
Hamiltonian is nothing but an energy, at least in classical mechanics 

386
00:28:11,403 --> 00:28:15,052
So in my respect that H is the operator 

387
00:28:15,315 --> 00:28:17,634
representing the observable energy of a system 

388
00:28:18,702 --> 00:28:22,501
Okay now we are gonna make a measurement of the energy of some system

389
00:28:22,714 --> 00:28:24,058
How do we do it? Let's not worry about that

390
00:28:24,444 --> 00:28:25,705
There is one way we can do it

391
00:28:26,151 --> 00:28:31,558
With E equals mc squared and then we weight the system carefully 

392
00:28:32,355 --> 00:28:37,950
Really really carefully, and in that way determine it's mass, and it's energy

393
00:28:38,912 --> 00:28:43,487
That is not a very efficient way to do it because the change of energy of a system

394
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:49,333
when you heat it up or something, it's so negligible but that's one way

395
00:28:49,716 --> 00:28:51,009
There are many ways to measure energy

396
00:28:52,742 --> 00:28:57,092
But one of the possible outcomes of the measurement of the energy of the system

397
00:28:58,387 --> 00:28:59,693
That of course depends on the system, 

398
00:29:00,387 --> 00:29:02,601
it's not something you can ask and answer in general

399
00:29:03,321 --> 00:29:08,798
But depending on the system, for example if you measure the energies of an atom

400
00:29:10,371 --> 00:29:16,622
You get one of a, denumerable family of the possible answers

401
00:29:16,875 --> 00:29:18,367
Namely the energy levels of the atom

402
00:29:19,525 --> 00:29:22,327
If you measure the energies of a harmonic oscillator

403
00:29:23,116 --> 00:29:26,720
Again you get a denumerable collection of possible answers

404
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:33,590
If you measure the energy of a particle moving in a none-closed orbit

405
00:29:37,611 --> 00:29:42,642
Then in fact you get a continuous possible family of possible answers

406
00:29:43,312 --> 00:29:47,231
So the question of what the energy are depends on the system

407
00:29:47,974 --> 00:29:51,493
And it depends on the choice, of course it's not a choice

408
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,145
The system has a Hamiltonian, it's just not up to you 

409
00:29:55,783 --> 00:29:58,163
to dictate to a system of what a Hamiltonian is

410
00:30:00,352 --> 00:30:03,141
It may be up to you to try to discover what a Hamiltonian is

411
00:30:03,873 --> 00:30:08,166
But let's use the terminology you get to chose the Hamiltonian

412
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,531
Needless to say you get to study different possibilities 

413
00:30:14,221 --> 00:30:17,695
And depending on the choice of the operator that you put here

414
00:30:17,986 --> 00:30:19,983
That you call H, you can get different energy levels

415
00:30:20,574 --> 00:30:23,184
How do you describe, sorry, how do you calculate 

416
00:30:23,427 --> 00:30:26,673
and determine what the possible outcome of the energy measurement are

417
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:28,994
And use the statement that 

418
00:30:29,191 --> 00:30:34,444
the values of the energy can take on are the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian

419
00:30:34,754 --> 00:30:36,396
Like any other observables

420
00:30:36,588 --> 00:30:42,883
So you write another equation, H on, let's call it the |i>

421
00:30:43,171 --> 00:30:47,363
|i> now represent an eigen state of the energy

422
00:30:49,108 --> 00:30:51,567
It doesn't represent any old basis

423
00:30:51,994 --> 00:30:57,767
It represent in particular the fact, maybe we should indicate that

424
00:30:58,803 --> 00:31:05,010
I'm writing in here the energy, the ith possible energy level

425
00:31:06,075 --> 00:31:10,807
H on E sub i is equal to the eigenvalue E sub i 

426
00:31:11,855 --> 00:31:14,911
times the eigenvector associated with that energy

427
00:31:15,726 --> 00:31:18,976
The notation is putting the E sub i inside the ket vector

428
00:31:19,249 --> 00:31:22,175
Just means nothing more than this is a ket vector 

429
00:31:22,741 --> 00:31:26,986
which happens to be the eigenvector of H with eigenvalue E sub i

430
00:31:28,661 --> 00:31:30,529
And how many such E sub i-s are there?

431
00:31:31,629 --> 00:31:33,577
Well there is a complete basis of them

432
00:31:34,837 --> 00:31:36,720
Whatever the dimensionality of a system is

433
00:31:37,122 --> 00:31:38,967
Whatever the dimensionality of the space of state is

434
00:31:40,168 --> 00:31:42,304
It's that many eigenvectors of the energy

435
00:31:43,842 --> 00:31:48,824
And your job is a physicist of trying to find them

436
00:31:51,331 --> 00:31:57,266
So that's the time independent Schrodinger equation

437
00:32:07,958 --> 00:32:11,570
Next thing we did, a lot of review tonight

438
00:32:12,158 --> 00:32:14,718
Next thing we did was to talk about the evolution, 

439
00:32:15,097 --> 00:32:19,369
time evolution of expectation values, average values

440
00:32:21,532 --> 00:32:24,553
I complained bitterly about the terminology expectation values

441
00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:27,776
But many many years ago I have given up on this

442
00:32:28,141 --> 00:32:31,639
So it's become expectation value, but really it should be average

443
00:32:35,194 --> 00:32:36,982
It's okay, I'm okay with expectation value 

444
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:39,864
I will use expectation value, but it really should be average

445
00:32:45,878 --> 00:32:47,030
And here is what we found 

446
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:52,000
What we said is the thing that change with time is a state vector

447
00:32:53,155 --> 00:32:56,466
So we are interested in calculating Psi of t 

448
00:32:57,571 --> 00:32:59,091
Remember the expectation value 

449
00:32:59,547 --> 00:33:01,524
I will just remind you the expectation value you get

450
00:33:02,136 --> 00:33:07,779
By sandwiching the observable in a sandwich 

451
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:13,037
between the bra version of the state vector and the ket version

452
00:33:13,455 --> 00:33:14,740
We've proved this, we've proved this 

453
00:33:15,247 --> 00:33:18,647
This is the same as the average, the statistical average 

454
00:33:20,539 --> 00:33:22,948
And I won't go back over that now

455
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:28,402
This is the average value of L, the observable L

456
00:33:29,554 --> 00:33:31,127
And we can ask how it changes with time

457
00:33:31,819 --> 00:33:34,185
It change with time because Psi can change with time

458
00:33:34,773 --> 00:33:36,513
And here we know how Psi change with time

459
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,218
This two factor of Psi here 

460
00:33:39,997 --> 00:33:43,175
So when we gonna differentiate this with respect to time

461
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:45,320
There will be two terms

462
00:33:45,718 --> 00:33:47,257
One coming from differentiating this

463
00:33:48,065 --> 00:33:49,634
And one coming from differentiating that 

464
00:33:51,778 --> 00:33:56,361
If you remember, if you flip from bra to ket you have to complex conjugate it

465
00:33:56,971 --> 00:33:59,632
And a complex conjugating change the sign of i

466
00:34:00,635 --> 00:34:03,927
You will come to the conclusion that this is equal to 

467
00:34:04,294 --> 00:34:05,607
Now I was getting the sign wrong

468
00:34:05,882 --> 00:34:06,795
Let me try to get the sign right

469
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:17,756
I think it's minus sign, times L H minus H L

470
00:34:21,395 --> 00:34:29,182
Average value of that, Psi, Psi

471
00:34:31,688 --> 00:34:32,817
We work that out

472
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:38,067
We use the L on Psi gives you H on Psi

473
00:34:39,261 --> 00:34:40,435
That's this piece over here 

474
00:34:41,132 --> 00:34:44,032
Now we use that L when it acts to the left 

475
00:34:45,202 --> 00:34:48,645
gives you a term with H acting to the left with a minus sign

476
00:34:50,415 --> 00:34:51,929
Okay so here is what we find then

477
00:34:52,247 --> 00:34:55,926
We find that the time derivative of the average of L

478
00:34:58,294 --> 00:34:58,984
Let's write it this way

479
00:34:59,288 --> 00:35:03,352
d by dt of the average of L

480
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:09,172
I will use that notation for the average of L as a function of time

481
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:14,468
is equal to minus i times 

482
00:35:15,123 --> 00:35:22,628
the average of the commutator of L with the Hamiltonian

483
00:35:24,994 --> 00:35:28,368
If you know what the Hamiltonian is as an operator or as an matrix

484
00:35:29,197 --> 00:35:32,238
And you know what L is as an operator or as an matrix

485
00:35:33,275 --> 00:35:37,519
You can compute the expect... the commutator 

486
00:35:40,268 --> 00:35:42,889
Now if you compute the commutator you compute it's average value

487
00:35:43,881 --> 00:35:48,258
Just use this rule, this sandwich rule, let's call it the sandwich rule

488
00:35:50,279 --> 00:35:54,884
And it tells you the right hand side tells you what the left hand side

489
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,518
How it changes with time

490
00:35:57,082 --> 00:35:59,198
If you find it odd it has an i there 

491
00:36:02,448 --> 00:36:03,671
Well I did it the first time I saw this

492
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:06,405
First time I saw this, I said wait a minute wait a minute 

493
00:36:06,722 --> 00:36:09,535
Time derivative of a real thing can't be imaginary

494
00:36:10,104 --> 00:36:15,762
We are gonna find out that the commutator of real things are always imaginary

495
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:19,574
So imaginary will go away, we will give you some example and you'll see

496
00:36:19,884 --> 00:36:23,845
this is not hard to prove, but we will do it by example

497
00:36:28,867 --> 00:36:30,470
Sometimes this is written in short hand

498
00:36:32,656 --> 00:36:34,458
The short hand is just the dL/dt 

499
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:40,583
is equal to minus i times the commutator of L with H

500
00:36:47,562 --> 00:36:50,822
But at least at this stage of our knowledge

501
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:54,753
What this means is it should always be sandwiched 

502
00:36:55,268 --> 00:36:59,888
and thought of as equation for the average value of things

503
00:37:01,872 --> 00:37:09,499
So there we have what we call the Heisenberg equations of motion for the system

504
00:37:12,958 --> 00:37:14,958
That brings us to the study of commutators

505
00:37:17,225 --> 00:37:21,210
The study of commutators and I wanna go through that just again for a little bit

506
00:37:23,064 --> 00:37:25,969
Commutators have some rule associated with them

507
00:37:26,842 --> 00:37:29,296
The rules are very very reminiscent

508
00:37:30,092 --> 00:37:33,003
of the rules of Poisson brackets 

509
00:37:34,165 --> 00:37:37,292
So go back and read about Poisson brackets 

510
00:37:40,712 --> 00:37:41,890
I will write down what the rules are, 

511
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:47,921
general rules, algebraic rule of Poisson brackets in commutators

512
00:37:48,842 --> 00:37:50,938
And I will just check, are they really true for both of them

513
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,096
Well the rules for Poisson brackets we did last quarter 

514
00:37:55,076 --> 00:37:59,383
Poisson brackets are written this way, A B, 

515
00:37:59,795 --> 00:38:00,857
I'm not gonna write them out 

516
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:04,571
in terms of p-s and q-s in terms of classical mechanics

517
00:38:05,955 --> 00:38:09,230
But there was a few simple rules associate with them

518
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:12,022
First of all there is some linearity rules 

519
00:38:13,536 --> 00:38:17,248
That if you add two operators, oh sorry

520
00:38:17,486 --> 00:38:20,181
If you add two things and then take the Poisson bracket with a third

521
00:38:20,479 --> 00:38:23,582
And so forth, this is certainly true for a commutator

522
00:38:24,389 --> 00:38:25,869
But there is a couple of non-trivial rule

523
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:31,268
Well first of all the Poisson bracket is odd 

524
00:38:31,608 --> 00:38:35,005
Which means if you interchange with two entries it changes sign

525
00:38:37,704 --> 00:38:42,782
Minus B A, that was one property

526
00:38:43,181 --> 00:38:46,090
This is certainly shared by the commutator

527
00:38:46,929 --> 00:38:50,227
If you interchange L and H you interchange these two terms

528
00:38:50,503 --> 00:38:52,036
And you change the sign of the commutator

529
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:53,849
So that's true the commutator also

530
00:38:59,345 --> 00:39:04,786
If A and B are now quantum variables, this is also equal to minus B times A

531
00:39:07,025 --> 00:39:10,196
There's really only other one important relationship

532
00:39:10,817 --> 00:39:18,239
It's a product rule, the product of A and B Poisson with C

533
00:39:21,069 --> 00:39:22,398
The operation of Poisson-ing

534
00:39:26,124 --> 00:39:29,300
If you remember the Poisson bracket was a combination of derivatives

535
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:36,419
Derivatives of various things, if you go and use that definition of Poisson bracket

536
00:39:37,087 --> 00:39:39,997
Use the rule for derivatives of products

537
00:39:40,866 --> 00:39:45,219
What you find out is this is equal to Poisson bracket side

538
00:39:46,522 --> 00:39:51,464
is equal to A times Poisson bracket of B with C 

539
00:39:52,824 --> 00:39:58,012
Plus the Poisson bracket of B with C times 

540
00:39:58,644 --> 00:40:02,161
Sorry Poisson bracket of A with C times B

541
00:40:04,488 --> 00:40:09,354
Now the order that you write down A and the Poisson bracket

542
00:40:09,624 --> 00:40:10,993
That's not important, these are just numbers

543
00:40:11,286 --> 00:40:13,240
These are just ordinary functions or numbers

544
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,075
And it doesn't matter which order you multiply them

545
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:20,959
But I wrote them in an order which I know 

546
00:40:21,305 --> 00:40:23,297
that the commutator would also satisfy

547
00:40:24,493 --> 00:40:26,883
Operators the order does matter

548
00:40:27,533 --> 00:40:31,834
So I wrote these in a specific order namely I put A on the left over here

549
00:40:32,203 --> 00:40:33,920
And then I put B on the right over here

550
00:40:34,802 --> 00:40:38,781
Maybe it's not too surprising, A up here on the left of this factor

551
00:40:39,343 --> 00:40:41,745
And B appears on the right, so I kept the order intact

552
00:40:42,957 --> 00:40:46,037
So let's see if this is true for commutators

553
00:40:46,746 --> 00:40:52,328
What would it say? It would say, well let's write it out

554
00:40:52,606 --> 00:41:00,934
A times commutator BC, sorry, go back

555
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:11,932
It would say that commutator of AB with C is equal to

556
00:41:12,489 --> 00:41:14,547
I put a question mark here, I don't know if it's equal yet

557
00:41:15,646 --> 00:41:28,086
A times a commutator of B with C plus A with C

558
00:41:30,277 --> 00:41:34,901
Ya, A with C times B, let's check if that's true

559
00:41:36,262 --> 00:41:38,737
This is very easy to do, we don't have to do any derivatives

560
00:41:39,012 --> 00:41:40,641
So what we have to do is write out the meaning of this

561
00:41:41,714 --> 00:41:48,809
Commutator of AB with C is the same as AB times C minus C times AB

562
00:41:49,428 --> 00:41:50,348
Everybody see why?

563
00:41:52,881 --> 00:41:56,799
First you put AB on the left time C, and then you put C on the left

564
00:41:57,402 --> 00:41:59,855
and AB on the right, then you take the difference 

565
00:42:00,376 --> 00:42:01,828
Definition of the commutator

566
00:42:02,863 --> 00:42:04,614
Let's see what we get on the right hand side

567
00:42:05,206 --> 00:42:11,647
On the right hand side, we get A times BC minus CB

568
00:42:14,342 --> 00:42:20,441
That's this term, and then from here we get plus AC minus CA

569
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:25,296
Times B, these are operators now

570
00:42:25,657 --> 00:42:28,282
And these calculations are operators, the order matters

571
00:42:29,332 --> 00:42:30,554
Okay let's see what we have 

572
00:42:31,098 --> 00:42:34,114
We have ABC, here is ABC that's good

573
00:42:36,051 --> 00:42:38,680
We have, so this is a friend

574
00:42:39,735 --> 00:42:43,740
We have minus CAB, that's this one over here, CAB

575
00:42:44,752 --> 00:42:45,559
That's also a friend

576
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:51,428
Our enemy are ACB, but they both occur the same way

577
00:42:51,865 --> 00:42:56,994
ABC, no no ACB, that's a bad one

578
00:42:57,605 --> 00:43:01,872
But here we have also ACB, one with a minus sign

579
00:43:02,878 --> 00:43:07,999
One with the plus sign, it was ACB minus ACB, and we're finished

580
00:43:08,506 --> 00:43:13,899
The commutator satisfy the same algebraic rule as the Poisson bracket

581
00:43:15,701 --> 00:43:17,843
Is it an accident? No of course it's not an accident

582
00:43:18,611 --> 00:43:21,799
But we will get to the deeper reason for it eventually 

583
00:43:23,832 --> 00:43:25,818
which comes first and which is more basic

584
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:28,603
Certainly the commutator is more basic

585
00:43:29,502 --> 00:43:32,164
Quantum mechanics is more basic than classical mechanics

586
00:43:32,513 --> 00:43:35,485
Classical mechanics is an approximation of quantum mechanics 

587
00:43:35,889 --> 00:43:37,133
So it stands to reason 

588
00:43:37,597 --> 00:43:42,839
there ought to be a classical approximation to the notion of commutators

589
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:44,844
And there is, it's a

590
00:43:46,191 --> 00:43:52,353
That leads us to speculate, if you like, 

591
00:43:53,438 --> 00:43:57,584
I will take it, it's not a speculation, I will take it as something would discover

592
00:43:58,261 --> 00:43:59,781
Or we are able to prove later

593
00:44:03,004 --> 00:44:05,861
That when we go from quantum mechanics to classical mechanics

594
00:44:07,322 --> 00:44:10,610
The Poisson bracket let's see,

595
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:16,017
The Poisson bracket becomes I think minus i

596
00:44:16,746 --> 00:44:19,680
Now this equality doesn't quite make sense

597
00:44:20,193 --> 00:44:22,389
This is something classical on the right hand side 

598
00:44:22,729 --> 00:44:31,754
We should put arrows there, Commutator A with B 

599
00:44:38,214 --> 00:44:41,242
>> In that last equation, it seem 

600
00:44:44,327 --> 00:44:47,008
>> It seems that the right side is twice as the left side is

601
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:48,832
Well I don't think so

602
00:44:49,871 --> 00:44:57,285
ABC, ABC, CAB, CAB with a minus sign

603
00:44:58,215 --> 00:44:59,857
And then we have a couple of extra terms 

604
00:45:00,291 --> 00:45:06,807
The extra terms are minus ACB plus ACB, ya

605
00:45:07,278 --> 00:45:10,466
Allow me to make this quick

606
00:45:11,023 --> 00:45:12,033
That's good, slow me down

607
00:45:14,868 --> 00:45:19,077
Now nothing in what I've done so far tells you 

608
00:45:19,461 --> 00:45:22,006
this should be identify exactly with that

609
00:45:22,447 --> 00:45:25,162
It might be identify with this times a numerical multiple

610
00:45:26,252 --> 00:45:29,070
The Poisson bracket might be seven times a commutator

611
00:45:29,433 --> 00:45:32,544
Or a quarter of the commutator if they are all still make sense

612
00:45:33,743 --> 00:45:38,266
If fact there is a dimensional difference between these

613
00:45:38,761 --> 00:45:43,913
Poisson brackets are derivatives of A with respect to X

614
00:45:44,669 --> 00:45:46,399
Derivatives of B with respect to p

615
00:45:47,606 --> 00:45:50,594
They have units which are different than just AB

616
00:45:52,194 --> 00:45:56,092
The difference of unit is actually soak up in Planck's constant

617
00:45:59,248 --> 00:46:01,560
If we work with Planck's constant equal to one

618
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:05,336
Then Poisson brackets are just minus i times commutators

619
00:46:06,189 --> 00:46:09,573
But for dimensional reason there is an h bar

620
00:46:10,197 --> 00:46:12,814
Let's write it another way, let's put the h bar on the left hand side

621
00:46:15,309 --> 00:46:21,354
Certainly classically, we think of commutator is very small

622
00:46:21,802 --> 00:46:23,460
In fact we think of it as essentially zero

623
00:46:24,015 --> 00:46:26,997
AB minus BA, so in the classical limit

624
00:46:28,024 --> 00:46:29,860
The commutator is something which is zero

625
00:46:30,648 --> 00:46:33,686
How does that happen? Well, it's the h bar here

626
00:46:34,377 --> 00:46:36,357
And h bar is very very small in units

627
00:46:36,837 --> 00:46:37,977
And h bar is very very small

628
00:46:38,913 --> 00:46:43,355
which are just ordinary units, units like meters seconds kilograms

629
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:47,592
h bar is incredibly small in numbers, ten to the minus thirty 

630
00:46:48,148 --> 00:46:53,499
It's a very small number, so in a classical approximation 

631
00:46:53,893 --> 00:46:56,142
Commutators are negligibly small

632
00:46:57,457 --> 00:47:01,058
But when keeping track of real quantum mechanics 

633
00:47:01,665 --> 00:47:03,141
The commutator is not zero

634
00:47:04,258 --> 00:47:11,816
So that's the meaning or the notion of the commutator 

635
00:47:12,689 --> 00:47:17,459
And the nice property now is that this relationship here

636
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:24,137
is simply the quantum analog of an equation we studied last quarter

637
00:47:25,405 --> 00:47:32,613
dL by dt is equal to the Poisson bracket of L with the Hamiltonian

638
00:47:38,364 --> 00:47:40,374
which matches quite well with this

639
00:47:41,135 --> 00:47:47,548
That is the essential reason at this stage for identifying H with a Hamiltonian

640
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:54,139
Classical mechanics when packaged in this fishy way called Poisson formulation

641
00:47:55,475 --> 00:47:58,524
Fishy Poisson formulation capture, you know, 

642
00:47:58,869 --> 00:48:04,967
organize everything into relations involving Poisson brackets and

643
00:48:05,238 --> 00:48:08,394
in particular it said dL by dt, L could be anything

644
00:48:09,487 --> 00:48:11,993
Incidentally L here is not the angular momentum, it's anything

645
00:48:13,305 --> 00:48:17,962
dL by dt was equal to the Poisson bracket of L with H

646
00:48:18,587 --> 00:48:22,330
and in quantum mechanics, in the sense of average value 

647
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:27,846
We found that dL by dt is minus i times the commutator 

648
00:48:29,658 --> 00:48:32,537
So that's the essence of the connection 

649
00:48:33,656 --> 00:48:38,058
between the Hamiltonian of classical mechanics and quantum mechanics

650
00:48:40,805 --> 00:48:45,181
>> (inaudible)

651
00:48:48,065 --> 00:48:51,147
L is any observable, any observable, 

652
00:48:52,293 --> 00:48:56,681
I used L for linear operator, but of course it should be Hermitian operator

653
00:48:57,033 --> 00:49:01,834
So I might have used H, but then I would have got caught and found that H

654
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:05,610
Oh H is Hermitian, and so is L

655
00:49:06,586 --> 00:49:10,857
But I use L for a generic observable

656
00:49:14,303 --> 00:49:15,881
So I assume that L is Hermitian 

657
00:49:17,987 --> 00:49:20,019
Originally I used it for linear 

658
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:25,863
But now I'm using it to mean linear and Hermitian

659
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:30,613
Alright L could be H, L could be H

660
00:49:32,669 --> 00:49:37,820
That's we could study the equation of motion of how H changes with time

661
00:49:38,674 --> 00:49:41,749
Or better yet, how average of H changes with time 

662
00:49:43,373 --> 00:49:51,715
Let's do so, here we are, dH by dt is equal to 

663
00:49:51,949 --> 00:49:55,504
minus i times the commutator of H with H 

664
00:49:57,183 --> 00:49:59,757
But the commutator of anything with itself is zero

665
00:50:01,501 --> 00:50:05,067
And so incidentally as the Poisson bracket of anything with itself

666
00:50:06,322 --> 00:50:08,081
Because Poisson brackets are odd, 

667
00:50:08,452 --> 00:50:10,834
they change sign when you interchanging two objects

668
00:50:12,497 --> 00:50:15,158
That means the Poisson bracket of a thing with itself is zero

669
00:50:15,922 --> 00:50:18,040
So from the classical point of view, 

670
00:50:18,402 --> 00:50:22,980
we could have derive the conservation of energy from the principle

671
00:50:23,546 --> 00:50:28,680
That the time derivative of energy is the Poisson bracket of the energy with itself

672
00:50:30,135 --> 00:50:33,609
Here we find in quantum mechanics are very similar things 

673
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:39,874
The time derivative of the, again the Hamiltonian is the Poisson bracket 

674
00:50:40,161 --> 00:50:44,763
It's the commutator of the Hamiltonian with itself 

675
00:50:45,091 --> 00:50:45,925
And therefore it's zero

676
00:50:47,386 --> 00:50:49,405
Energy is conserved in quantum mechanics, 

677
00:50:49,794 --> 00:50:53,155
so at least the average of the energy is conserve

678
00:50:53,429 --> 00:50:54,271
Now it's better than that, 

679
00:50:55,147 --> 00:50:58,028
there is very definite sense in which energy is exactly conserved 

680
00:51:01,861 --> 00:51:02,658
But not for tonight 

681
00:51:07,407 --> 00:51:16,107
>> In the introductory example where you talk about two operators

682
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:26,885
>>physical example of that should include two object of particles?

683
00:51:27,868 --> 00:51:30,132
We have two spins, ya, absolutely

684
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:36,678
In fact whenever we built a system out of two systems

685
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:42,507
In general the observables of one of the system 

686
00:51:43,516 --> 00:51:45,644
and the observables of the other system commutes to each other

687
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:52,045
That's why you can measure the position of me and Samuel J simultaneously

688
00:51:52,836 --> 00:51:56,533
Because we are two, because our position commutes

689
00:51:57,079 --> 00:52:02,697
So do our spins, I think that is the question you are asking?

690
00:52:06,053 --> 00:52:08,121
But we haven't come to yet

691
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:11,051
As well as I gonna go latter, we will get to it

692
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:14,582
To the question of composing systems 

693
00:52:15,363 --> 00:52:19,177
Taking systems and making bigger systems out of composing them

694
00:52:19,438 --> 00:52:21,296
That would bring us to the issue of entanglement 

695
00:52:22,894 --> 00:52:25,290
I have a feeling we probably won't quite get there

696
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:27,205
But maybe we will partly get there

697
00:52:28,955 --> 00:52:32,103
Alright the next thing we wanna do is to solve Schrodinger equation

698
00:52:32,572 --> 00:52:36,012
I don't mean the one for the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors 

699
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:40,230
That we solve by standard methods 

700
00:52:40,427 --> 00:52:44,652
if we happened to know what the Hamiltonian is

701
00:52:44,843 --> 00:52:47,149
Particularly if we happen to know some matrix form

702
00:52:48,288 --> 00:52:51,741
Then we are just calculating the eigenvectors or eigenvalues of some matrix

703
00:52:52,021 --> 00:52:53,336
Let's suppose that's done 

704
00:52:53,593 --> 00:52:56,058
We have the eigenvectors, we have the eigenvalues 

705
00:52:57,721 --> 00:53:01,452
Let's now find the general solution of Schrodinger's equation

706
00:53:02,189 --> 00:53:04,430
Another words how things evolve with time 

707
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:20,724
You know I realize that all of these are abstract that

708
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:25,908
the only system that we have to apply these all to is

709
00:53:26,129 --> 00:53:27,417
the world's simplest system once again

710
00:53:27,883 --> 00:53:28,860
And that's very not much

711
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:32,274
So at this stage, you probably saying to yourselves

712
00:53:32,746 --> 00:53:35,483
when are we going to be thinking about real things

713
00:53:35,883 --> 00:53:41,430
Objects systems, we will, we will, by all means

714
00:53:44,237 --> 00:53:46,368
But I think having all these apparatus 

715
00:53:47,476 --> 00:53:50,145
abstract formulation of quantum mechanics

716
00:53:50,359 --> 00:53:55,119
Will make it very easy and quick to start applying it to a lot of things

717
00:53:56,664 --> 00:54:02,233
>> We didn't know the H for this spin system yet

718
00:54:02,623 --> 00:54:05,266
Well, okay, so let me answer that right now

719
00:54:08,398 --> 00:54:10,501
That depends on what we do with the spin

720
00:54:11,349 --> 00:54:16,041
If we have a spin in three-space far from anything else

721
00:54:17,602 --> 00:54:21,050
Then it's energy or it's Hamiltonian is just basically zero

722
00:54:21,323 --> 00:54:25,813
Incidentally adding a constant to a Hamiltonian doesn't do anything

723
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:29,035
And the reason is because the constant commutes with everything

724
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:32,709
So apart from possible added to the constant

725
00:54:33,216 --> 00:54:35,469
The spin which is not around anything else

726
00:54:35,712 --> 00:54:37,210
It's just, the Hamiltonian is zero

727
00:54:37,952 --> 00:54:40,266
And that means it doesn't change with time

728
00:54:40,733 --> 00:54:44,502
If you put it in a magnetic field, if it happens to be a real spin of electron

729
00:54:44,728 --> 00:54:45,755
You put in a magnetic field 

730
00:54:46,471 --> 00:54:49,956
The magnetic field induces Hamiltonian which helps we will get to it tonight

731
00:54:51,003 --> 00:54:54,603
And it causes the spin to do things, to have a time-dependence 

732
00:54:56,061 --> 00:54:59,038
And then what the Hamiltonian would be would have to do with

733
00:54:59,268 --> 00:55:01,240
which direction the magnetic field was in

734
00:55:02,624 --> 00:55:07,386
So Hamiltonians can be changed, I mean you can change the Hamiltonian

735
00:55:07,621 --> 00:55:09,760
by changing the direction of a magnetic field 

736
00:55:12,794 --> 00:55:15,866
But we will come, I hope we can get to the example tonight

737
00:55:16,485 --> 00:55:22,321
But let's just first write down the general solution of the Schrodinger equation

738
00:55:22,977 --> 00:55:28,271
To do that, we start by saying let there be a basis for eigenvectors

739
00:55:29,282 --> 00:55:32,753
I guess we call it, this is the same as E sub i

740
00:55:34,991 --> 00:55:38,698
If I don't want to write E sub i, I will just write down the ith eigenvector

741
00:55:39,455 --> 00:55:43,416
But it means the eigenvector with the energy E sub i

742
00:55:44,556 --> 00:55:49,198
Alright we can take any states since i or E sub i are basis of states

743
00:55:50,021 --> 00:55:54,186
We can take any state, let's call it A

744
00:55:55,869 --> 00:55:58,864
Or should we call it Psi, let's see what should I call it in my notes

745
00:56:01,326 --> 00:56:03,653
No I think I called it Psi, I did, I called it Psi

746
00:56:13,358 --> 00:56:15,696
And let's think of Psi at time zero

747
00:56:17,397 --> 00:56:20,655
Well no, let's leave the time arbitrary 

748
00:56:23,023 --> 00:56:28,702
Psi is a sum of all the eigenstates, so all the eigenvalues

749
00:56:29,568 --> 00:56:33,123
of some set of coefficients, alpha sub i

750
00:56:34,103 --> 00:56:35,800
I've used the term alpha in the past 

751
00:56:36,222 --> 00:56:40,326
to denote the coefficients of states of basis vectors

752
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:46,434
So any states whatever can be written as 

753
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:49,098
a superposition of eigenvectors of the energy

754
00:56:49,481 --> 00:56:54,336
Since the eigenvectors of a Hermitian operator are a complete basis

755
00:56:55,299 --> 00:56:57,560
Alright so this is Psi, let's say the time is equal to zero

756
00:56:59,844 --> 00:57:04,573
Now how does the state change with time

757
00:57:04,909 --> 00:57:09,876
What's changing here? Well the state |i> is just a fix set of states

758
00:57:10,737 --> 00:57:15,109
It's the alpha which changed, the coefficients here which change with time

759
00:57:18,441 --> 00:57:23,708
Alright so the coefficient in the expansion of an arbitrary state 

760
00:57:23,957 --> 00:57:26,560
are typically time dependent coefficients

761
00:57:26,888 --> 00:57:28,944
That's what gives rise to the time dependence 

762
00:57:29,644 --> 00:57:31,892
In expectation values and other things

763
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:35,263
Now let's write the Schrodinger equation

764
00:57:36,001 --> 00:57:41,984
So we have i Psi dot, sorry we have Psi dot which can now write,

765
00:57:42,276 --> 00:57:43,841
Let's take Psi dot, d by dt of Psi

766
00:57:45,122 --> 00:57:50,453
d Psi d t, that's equal from here 

767
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:57,912
sum of i, d alpha sub i of t with respect to t, times |i>, 

768
00:57:58,721 --> 00:58:03,959
to differentiate the states, all we do is to differentiate the individual coefficients

769
00:58:04,909 --> 00:58:09,232
now Schrodinger's equation tells us to set that equals to minus i

770
00:58:13,225 --> 00:58:16,036
Oh, different i, holy smoke

771
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:22,124
Okay, j, j,

772
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:37,158
set that equals to minus i times H acting on this

773
00:58:38,114 --> 00:58:41,441
But H can be brought in through the summation here

774
00:58:42,077 --> 00:58:44,068
And this can just be written as summation of i

775
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:49,559
The coefficient numbers, alpha j, sum over j

776
00:58:51,572 --> 00:58:56,761
Alpha j of t, H on |j>

777
00:58:58,870 --> 00:58:59,889
Now what is H on |j>?

778
00:59:02,366 --> 00:59:03,443
Somebody said zero?

779
00:59:06,925 --> 00:59:10,819
No no no no no

780
00:59:17,502 --> 00:59:19,883
|i> and E sub i are the same vectors

781
00:59:20,198 --> 00:59:22,047
Go up to the top equation, 

782
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:28,581
H on the ith eigenvector is the energy E sub i on the ith eigenvector

783
00:59:29,549 --> 00:59:34,773
Okay? So this just becomes E sub j

784
00:59:40,493 --> 00:59:47,607
Here we have on the left hand side a sum of basis vectors

785
00:59:48,364 --> 00:59:51,324
With coefficients alpha j, sorry

786
00:59:52,425 --> 00:59:54,000
Where are we? Did I make a mistake here?

787
00:59:55,306 --> 00:59:58,488
Oh sorry, this should have gone down here

788
01:00:00,205 --> 01:00:06,827
This is wrong, here, this should have gone down here

789
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:17,517
This is sum on j, d by dt of alpha j, and then

790
01:00:20,852 --> 01:00:22,067
>> the i should be j

791
01:00:25,418 --> 01:00:26,571
I'm lost

792
01:00:43,870 --> 01:00:45,336
this is correct up to here

793
01:00:47,794 --> 01:00:56,315
Let's, okay, let's go back to here

794
01:00:56,738 --> 01:01:04,676
And now let's calculate the time derivative of this 

795
01:01:06,686 --> 01:01:13,795
What do we do? We put in minus i times H on |j>

796
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:25,167
Here is where I used H on j, is equal to E j on |j>

797
01:01:26,492 --> 01:01:28,195
I think that's what I have a moment ago anyway, isn't it?

798
01:01:29,485 --> 01:01:31,296
It's exactly what I have, minus I to get the minus i

799
01:01:31,861 --> 01:01:36,258
Alright this thing and this thing are the same 

800
01:01:38,083 --> 01:01:41,092
So this sum must be exactly the same as this sum

801
01:01:42,718 --> 01:01:46,419
If you have two sums, or basis vectors 

802
01:01:47,912 --> 01:01:49,893
The coefficients must be the same 

803
01:01:52,457 --> 01:01:54,873
If you have two sets of basis vectors, sorry

804
01:01:55,486 --> 01:01:59,550
If you have two linear superposition of the same set of basis vectors

805
01:02:01,186 --> 01:02:02,587
And they are equal to each other, 

806
01:02:02,978 --> 01:02:05,796
then the individual coefficient have to be equal to each other

807
01:02:06,415 --> 01:02:19,291
So it follows that d alpha by d t is equal to minus i times d alpha j by dt

808
01:02:20,229 --> 01:02:27,169
E j alpha j, all I've done is set d alpha dt 

809
01:02:27,975 --> 01:02:30,636
equal to the coefficient in this equation over here

810
01:02:34,522 --> 01:02:37,828
And that's the whole upshot, it tells you how the alphas change with time

811
01:02:40,121 --> 01:02:42,844
For each j, this is the differentially equation 

812
01:02:43,218 --> 01:02:46,465
Just think of this as the differential equation of alpha

813
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:48,704
What's the solution of differential equation?

814
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:51,237
We've done this kind of equation over and over again

815
01:02:52,367 --> 01:02:56,016
The time derivative of something is proportional to the same thing

816
01:02:56,519 --> 01:03:00,942
To the thing itself, exponential solutions right?

817
01:03:01,463 --> 01:03:08,796
So the solution of this equation is alpha j equals alpha j at time zero

818
01:03:09,677 --> 01:03:14,005
times e to the minus i E j t

819
01:03:15,661 --> 01:03:19,137
If we differentiate alpha j with respect to t

820
01:03:19,746 --> 01:03:24,511
It will bring down this factor minus i E sub j times the same thing

821
01:03:25,813 --> 01:03:30,119
So we can now write the general solution of the Schrodinger equation

822
01:03:31,084 --> 01:03:34,833
We solve it for each individual eigenvector 

823
01:03:35,067 --> 01:03:37,493
This is the way individual eigenvector 

824
01:03:37,721 --> 01:03:40,370
The individual coefficient alpha change with time

825
01:03:40,998 --> 01:03:45,784
But now we can go back, let's go back

826
01:03:51,730 --> 01:04:00,074
To the original equation, that the state vector is a summed over the eigenvectors

827
01:04:01,108 --> 01:04:03,727
And let's plug in what we now know about alpha 

828
01:04:05,211 --> 01:04:09,878
Now we solve for alpha and here we can write the general state vector time t

829
01:04:11,625 --> 01:04:13,256
If you know it at time zero

830
01:04:14,547 --> 01:04:16,270
Let's suppose we know it at time zero

831
01:04:17,673 --> 01:04:23,721
At time zero, it was just alpha j of time zero times j

832
01:04:26,108 --> 01:04:30,422
All it happens is each alpha j picks up a time dependence 

833
01:04:31,137 --> 01:04:35,646
and the time dependence is just governed by the energy of the state 

834
01:04:45,772 --> 01:04:49,647
Too quick?

835
01:04:50,736 --> 01:04:54,800
That's all you do to find the general solution is you take the state 

836
01:04:55,147 --> 01:04:58,088
you break it up into eigenvectors of a Hamiltonian

837
01:05:01,365 --> 01:05:03,254
And then whenever was it time zero

838
01:05:03,890 --> 01:05:09,806
The only thing that happens is that of each entries here change with time

839
01:05:10,190 --> 01:05:14,313
with an e to the minus i, times the energy of the state

840
01:05:15,654 --> 01:05:18,153
Where would the h bar go in this formula? Anybody know?

841
01:05:24,039 --> 01:05:27,606
Underneath the i, underneath the energy, or underneath the time

842
01:05:27,878 --> 01:05:31,988
It doesn't matter, but it goes into the denominator here

843
01:05:37,397 --> 01:05:42,762
This is the connection between energy and oscillations okay?

844
01:05:43,235 --> 01:05:45,473
This is the oscillations of the wave function 

845
01:05:45,776 --> 01:05:47,063
Not oscillations of real things, 

846
01:05:47,962 --> 01:05:51,721
but oscillations of the coefficients of the state vectors

847
01:05:58,624 --> 01:06:00,930
While we are at it, let's do one more thing

848
01:06:03,975 --> 01:06:07,111
Let's use our general solution of the Schrodinger equation 

849
01:06:07,937 --> 01:06:12,520
To calculate how the average of L changes with time

850
01:06:13,266 --> 01:06:17,877
We have an equation for it, but now we actually know how Psi changes with time

851
01:06:18,526 --> 01:06:21,570
And this is just a little bit of, not a gymnastic, 

852
01:06:21,828 --> 01:06:24,390
just a little bit of a fiddling around with equations

853
01:06:25,383 --> 01:06:29,553
Some of you may recognize the equation we are about to get

854
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:31,296
But whether we recognize it or not

855
01:06:31,549 --> 01:06:36,435
It's just explaining how the symbols are used if you like

856
01:06:37,594 --> 01:06:45,146
Okay, let's calculate, given that the state change like so

857
01:06:46,366 --> 01:06:56,197
Let's ask how the expectation value of an arbitrary observable changes

858
01:06:56,458 --> 01:06:58,327
What do you have to know to know 

859
01:06:58,604 --> 01:07:03,497
how the average of the expectation value of L changes

860
01:07:03,731 --> 01:07:06,576
L is some operator, I haven't told you what operator 

861
01:07:07,817 --> 01:07:10,906
Of course you need to know what operator in order to say how it changes

862
01:07:11,232 --> 01:07:16,357
Of course you do, but still, we can go a little ways

863
01:07:17,259 --> 01:07:20,900
Let's plug in this formula for Psi of t

864
01:07:22,022 --> 01:07:35,663
This is sum of j, alpha sub j, e to the minus i E j t times |j>

865
01:07:38,058 --> 01:07:41,883
Now we have L, put L over here

866
01:07:42,786 --> 01:07:45,617
And now we are gonna do the same thing to this bra vector over here

867
01:07:45,866 --> 01:07:47,746
But what happen when we do a bra vector?

868
01:07:47,965 --> 01:07:51,176
Let's do the bra vector, the bra vector is Psi of t

869
01:07:52,212 --> 01:07:56,075
is a summation, we better use a different summation variable k

870
01:07:57,309 --> 01:08:02,992
And then we will have alpha star sub k of zero

871
01:08:04,311 --> 01:08:08,243
And you go from bras to kets you have to complex conjugate

872
01:08:08,768 --> 01:08:15,017
We will also have to change this to e to the plus i E sub k t, 

873
01:08:16,297 --> 01:08:19,356
times the bra vector <k

|874
01:08:21,527 --> 01:08:26,667
I've changed the summation index here so I don't confuse it with this one

875
01:08:27,257 --> 01:08:31,013
I've complex conjugate it, complex conjugate it here

876
01:08:31,654 --> 01:08:34,521
And flip from kets to bras

877
01:08:35,382 --> 01:08:36,839
Alright so I can put this over here 

878
01:08:38,105 --> 01:08:55,817
Summation of a k, <k| alpha star <k|, at time zero

879
01:09:01,970 --> 01:09:10,325
This is at time zero, times E to the plus i E k t

880
01:09:11,966 --> 01:09:15,794
So it's a double sum, it's a double sum over k

881
01:09:16,061 --> 01:09:18,321
And j that's not terribly illuminating

882
01:09:18,570 --> 01:09:24,036
But that's just for fun, let's work it out

883
01:09:24,727 --> 01:09:26,993
What's the inner product of <k| with |j>?

884
01:09:27,209 --> 01:09:30,639
Oh no, not sorry, it's not the inner product of <k| with |j>

885
01:09:31,607 --> 01:09:35,471
What we see here is L sandwiched between |j> and <k

|886
01:09:36,647 --> 01:09:42,250
L sandwiched between |j> and <k| the operator L acts on a state |j>

887
01:09:42,681 --> 01:09:44,258
And then you project it onto <k

|888
01:09:44,748 --> 01:09:47,735
Let's give that a name, let's call that L kj 

889
01:09:49,474 --> 01:09:52,238
That's exactly the kind of matrix element we compute it 

890
01:09:52,805 --> 01:09:56,205
when we talk about the matrix representation of the observables

891
01:09:57,213 --> 01:10:04,478
The inner product of alpha, sorry, of L on j with k

892
01:10:05,027 --> 01:10:11,056
That's what we call L kj, just the matrix representation of the observable 

893
01:10:11,495 --> 01:10:20,576
And then we have alpha star k of zero, alpha j of zero

894
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:23,754
I will say we talk about that in a moment 

895
01:10:24,111 --> 01:10:34,987
And then we have a phase e to the i (E sub k minus E sub j) times t

896
01:10:36,721 --> 01:10:38,313
Summed over j and k

897
01:10:41,368 --> 01:10:44,789
You know the main reason we did this was just to illustrate the machinery

898
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:50,556
I did not do this because this is a formula of any importance right now

899
01:10:50,852 --> 01:10:54,185
But some of you may nevertheless recognize it

900
01:10:55,106 --> 01:10:59,807
It is Heisenberg matrix formulations of quantum mechanics

901
01:11:00,401 --> 01:11:05,285
Heisenberg formulations of the way averages change with time

902
01:11:06,088 --> 01:11:09,227
If you go back to Heisenberg's first paper on quantum mechanics

903
01:11:09,615 --> 01:11:13,257
He guessed this formula, basically just guessed this formula

904
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:18,633
Every observables have two frequencies associate with it

905
01:11:19,944 --> 01:11:25,146
That was weird, it was common for people to understand that 

906
01:11:25,585 --> 01:11:28,635
An observable might be an oscillating observable 

907
01:11:29,276 --> 01:11:32,573
It might be something that oscillate, we have a frequency that oscillate with it

908
01:11:33,928 --> 01:11:35,173
But Heisenberg said 

909
01:11:35,539 --> 01:11:40,985
there are two frequencies associates with every matrix element of an observable

910
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:45,478
This is where it came from, no, this came out of Heisenberg's head

911
01:11:46,252 --> 01:11:48,832
But this is the way Dirac explained what 

912
01:11:49,365 --> 01:11:59,467
This is the way Dirac understood what Heisenberg was saying to this machinery

913
01:12:01,706 --> 01:12:05,346
First just the pieces, this represent just the observable 

914
01:12:06,087 --> 01:12:07,422
Whatever the observable is 

915
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:09,372
It's just the matrix representation

916
01:12:10,296 --> 01:12:12,532
These things have to do with the initial state

917
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:14,383
The state at time equal to zero

918
01:12:16,013 --> 01:12:19,292
And these things here have to do with things change with time 

919
01:12:20,297 --> 01:12:25,185
Everything change with time with two separate frequencies

920
01:12:26,089 --> 01:12:27,628
And then you sum it all together

921
01:12:27,962 --> 01:12:30,695
And that tells you how L changes with time 

922
01:12:31,298 --> 01:12:32,955
How the average of L changes with time 

923
01:12:34,954 --> 01:12:37,723
So we are putting together, a bunch of machinery that we will use

924
01:12:39,607 --> 01:12:41,242
Are there any questions?

925
01:12:42,233 --> 01:12:45,127
>> While I reading the case, 

926
01:12:45,733 --> 01:12:49,322
>> Is the magnitude of the alphas stay the same over time?

927
01:12:49,570 --> 01:12:52,948
The alphas are fixed, the alphas are just the time equals to zero, period

928
01:12:53,254 --> 01:12:56,044
Yes, I think you are going back here 

929
01:12:56,665 --> 01:13:00,477
Yes and that's correct, the magnitudes of alphas stay fixed

930
01:13:00,770 --> 01:13:04,370
It's the relative phases between them 

931
01:13:05,171 --> 01:13:10,400
So all the time evolution has to do with these relative phases

932
01:13:12,739 --> 01:13:15,475
>> So the equation is partial?

933
01:13:16,206 --> 01:13:17,045
Is what?

934
01:13:17,302 --> 01:13:18,399
>> partial?

935
01:13:19,049 --> 01:13:22,372
Oh, it actually doesn't matters

936
01:13:24,436 --> 01:13:26,958
This just mean the whole derivative with respect to time 

937
01:13:27,192 --> 01:13:29,070
It's usually written as a partial derivative 

938
01:13:29,327 --> 01:13:33,367
It just means, it could be written as total derivative, same thing

939
01:13:33,598 --> 01:13:34,595
Psi only depends on time 

940
01:13:35,978 --> 01:13:38,532
>> Is Psi function of position?

941
01:13:38,959 --> 01:13:41,453
It's, ya, okay, that's right

942
01:13:43,025 --> 01:13:47,544
We will eventually thinking Psi as a function of time and position

943
01:13:47,825 --> 01:13:55,106
And that's why, that's why, for the moment it doesn't matter what do we use

944
01:13:56,233 --> 01:14:00,113
Partial derivative or total derivative, it just mean the change in Psi in a small time

945
01:14:02,237 --> 01:14:04,783
And it doesn't matter which 

946
01:14:05,727 --> 01:14:09,907
>>When you directed time depend on Schrodinger equation

947
01:14:10,134 --> 01:14:13,762
>> You used the fact that the state stays orthogonal all the time ?

948
01:14:14,686 --> 01:14:16,596
>> I think that is an empirical fact

949
01:14:17,227 --> 01:14:26,255
Well, it is an empirical fact, but in fact I think it's much more than that

950
01:14:28,186 --> 01:14:29,878
The evidence is much more than that

951
01:14:30,101 --> 01:14:31,337
It's also an empirical fact 

952
01:14:32,294 --> 01:14:34,406
It's a curious empirical fact 

953
01:14:35,458 --> 01:14:37,584
People are trying to change quantum mechanics 

954
01:14:39,376 --> 01:14:42,811
It seems to be just as hard to change quantum mechanics as it is 

955
01:14:43,231 --> 01:14:45,775
to change arithmetic or logic

956
01:14:49,276 --> 01:14:53,123
As you start fooling around with it and try to change the rules

957
01:14:53,625 --> 01:14:56,900
You will very quickly find something really bad happens

958
01:14:57,844 --> 01:14:59,538
The probability is not conserved 

959
01:15:01,734 --> 01:15:03,233
The probability is not positive 

960
01:15:05,348 --> 01:15:10,558
Terrible non-localities happens when you can communicate infinite distances

961
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:18,055
And so quantum mechanics is not a thing can be easily changed

962
01:15:19,061 --> 01:15:22,203
In fact there was no known changes that can be made in it

963
01:15:23,917 --> 01:15:26,685
Of course there is one known change you can make

964
01:15:27,304 --> 01:15:29,229
You can just replace it by classical mechanics

965
01:15:29,555 --> 01:15:30,899
That's a consistent theory

966
01:15:31,704 --> 01:15:35,110
The reason it's a consistent theory is there is a good limit of quantum mechanics

967
01:15:36,661 --> 01:15:40,409
But there is no way to change it, you know to deform it a little bit

968
01:15:41,554 --> 01:15:45,667
A friend David Finkelstein who is very wise, is a very wise man

969
01:15:46,654 --> 01:15:47,400
Great scientist, 

970
01:15:48,467 --> 01:15:52,828
once explained to me that there are two kinds of revolutions in physics

971
01:15:53,459 --> 01:15:57,667
He call one the plastic flow and the other a brittle cracking 

972
01:15:58,772 --> 01:15:59,945
What he meant by that, 

973
01:16:01,004 --> 01:16:04,544
he consider for example general relativity to be plastic flow

974
01:16:05,386 --> 01:16:07,944
You can change it a little bit, you can deform it a little bit

975
01:16:08,198 --> 01:16:12,291
You can change the Einstein's equation by changing variables 

976
01:16:13,725 --> 01:16:18,613
It's not something that you can not change at all

977
01:16:18,902 --> 01:16:20,484
You can change it a little way and deform it

978
01:16:21,569 --> 01:16:24,337
Special relativity is very hard to change 

979
01:16:24,777 --> 01:16:29,702
Once you change special relativity, it's very brittle

980
01:16:31,228 --> 01:16:34,119
The whole structure of it goes down the drain

981
01:16:34,899 --> 01:16:37,764
But you probably, but nevertheless, you cloud change it a little bit

982
01:16:38,149 --> 01:16:41,995
It's hard to change it in general relativity, things go wrong

983
01:16:42,217 --> 01:16:44,376
But quantum mechanics is absolutely brittle

984
01:16:45,125 --> 01:16:50,746
And by that he meant, not the theory is endangered of being broken by anything

985
01:16:51,659 --> 01:16:54,586
But that if you try to change it, you will get broken

986
01:17:00,701 --> 01:17:02,491
So quantum mechanics is very hard to change 

987
01:17:03,278 --> 01:17:05,532
And I think the evidence for that is just

988
01:17:05,757 --> 01:17:07,939
all of the years which people are trying to change it

989
01:17:10,745 --> 01:17:13,029
>> So the (inaudible)

990
01:17:17,991 --> 01:17:21,482
>> Is the reason we know that the real number because the eigen states

991
01:17:22,113 --> 01:17:25,030
>> that we chose the eigen state of the 

992
01:17:26,761 --> 01:17:33,550
Yes, we derive from unitarity, 

993
01:17:33,803 --> 01:17:39,004
unitarity is the condition that U dagger U is equal to one or I, 

994
01:17:40,274 --> 01:17:43,686
it's called unitary, from that we derive that the Hamiltonian is Hermitian

995
01:17:44,019 --> 01:17:47,710
And from that we can derive that it's eigenvalues are real

996
01:17:53,604 --> 01:17:55,867
Of what? Syntax?

997
01:17:57,883 --> 01:18:03,126
>> (inaudible) H or the ket vector E sub i

998
01:18:03,439 --> 01:18:08,558
>> the first E sub i on the right hand side of the equation is an eigenvalue?

999
01:18:08,953 --> 01:18:16,460
No, no, okay, it's, this whole thing is a eigenvalue, eigenvector 

1000
01:18:17,756 --> 01:18:20,671
But it's an eigenvector with eigenvalue E sub i

1001
01:18:21,016 --> 01:18:25,348
So you can, you are labeling the eigenvector by their eigenvalues 

1002
01:18:28,857 --> 01:18:31,481
Here is just the eigenvalue, right

1003
01:18:33,808 --> 01:18:38,571
And incidentally, this is a case where repeated indices do not get summed over

1004
01:18:39,129 --> 01:18:41,878
This is a case of the non-summation convention

1005
01:18:46,034 --> 01:18:51,332
Let's apply some of these apparatus to the problem of a single spin

1006
01:18:51,976 --> 01:18:53,580
The spin in a magnetic field

1007
01:19:00,278 --> 01:19:01,737
Let's see if we can calculate, 

1008
01:19:02,105 --> 01:19:06,456
and in particular how the average of the components of the spins change

1009
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:12,882
As we do this, depending on your memory for classical physics

1010
01:19:13,443 --> 01:19:16,419
You may start to find some of them familiar

1011
01:19:18,422 --> 01:19:22,407
If not, I will remind you

1012
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,802
>> It's not as bad as finger on the old plate 

1013
01:19:41,246 --> 01:19:44,647
No no it's not, no, it is not

1014
01:19:46,041 --> 01:19:49,479
That wasn't terribly bad, it just remind me of my cat in the middle of the night

1015
01:19:51,981 --> 01:19:53,530
Okay we have a single spin

1016
01:19:55,782 --> 01:19:57,803
Let's put the spin into a magnetic field 

1017
01:20:00,257 --> 01:20:02,827
If we put a spin into magnetic field along 

1018
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:05,715
Let's take the z axis, it's very simple

1019
01:20:06,343 --> 01:20:08,686
Let's take the z axis put the spin in

1020
01:20:08,967 --> 01:20:11,795
Put the magnetic field along the z axis

1021
01:20:13,823 --> 01:20:18,055
A spin in particular, a spin of a charged particle 

1022
01:20:18,716 --> 01:20:20,750
is a little electro magnet

1023
01:20:21,273 --> 01:20:24,281
Charged particles spins around, if it spin around

1024
01:20:24,492 --> 01:20:27,275
There was a current of flow and it creates a little magnet

1025
01:20:28,914 --> 01:20:30,601
Put a magnet in a magnetic field 

1026
01:20:31,155 --> 01:20:34,465
And you get an energy, and basically the energy is proportional

1027
01:20:34,705 --> 01:20:37,954
to the misalignment of the magnet field with the spin

1028
01:20:38,925 --> 01:20:39,971
With the axis of the spin

1029
01:20:41,389 --> 01:20:53,082
And the simple formula is that the energy is proportional to the dot product

1030
01:20:54,177 --> 01:20:56,759
of the spin with the magnetic field

1031
01:20:58,444 --> 01:20:59,501
That's all we are gonna start

1032
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:03,737
We are gonna start with an energy which is proportional to the magnetic field

1033
01:21:05,958 --> 01:21:09,421
And the magnetic field is along the z axis 

1034
01:21:10,218 --> 01:21:13,606
So what is the dot product of the spin with an magnetic field?

1035
01:21:14,134 --> 01:21:16,873
It's going to be proportional to the z component of spin?

1036
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:20,490
The dot product to the spin with the magnetic field

1037
01:21:20,745 --> 01:21:25,950
would be the component of the spin along the axis of the magnetic field

1038
01:21:26,534 --> 01:21:29,393
That's a guess, okay, I could take that as a guess

1039
01:21:29,686 --> 01:21:34,856
Which we could then study and ask if the experiment on the spin agree with it

1040
01:21:36,437 --> 01:21:39,742
Okay so we have a spin, we have a magnetic field along z axis

1041
01:21:40,192 --> 01:21:41,431
Let's call it B sub z

1042
01:21:42,568 --> 01:21:48,807
And we have a spin, and the spin has components sigma x sigma y and sigma z

1043
01:21:49,036 --> 01:21:50,126
People ask me incidentally 

1044
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:54,593
why in the book I'm writing about quantum mechanics has few figures, 

1045
01:21:55,990 --> 01:21:57,871
there are lots of figures in classical mechanics book

1046
01:21:58,572 --> 01:22:00,911
The reason is very simple, I mean the real reason

1047
01:22:01,379 --> 01:22:03,523
You can't draw a quantum mechanical system

1048
01:22:03,916 --> 01:22:08,036
Quantum mechanical system are the very nature not things that you could draw

1049
01:22:08,863 --> 01:22:12,048
If you could draw then you will always be trying to draw a thing 

1050
01:22:12,424 --> 01:22:14,514
Which can not simultaneously make sense

1051
01:22:15,832 --> 01:22:18,959
In particular if I try to draw the components of the spin

1052
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:23,042
Try to draw the components of a spin which don't commute with each other

1053
01:22:23,845 --> 01:22:26,443
And it doesn't make sense to draw them

1054
01:22:26,713 --> 01:22:27,938
Nevertheless there it is 

1055
01:22:28,375 --> 01:22:29,671
Magnetic field and the spin

1056
01:22:31,553 --> 01:22:34,597
And we are just going to write now

1057
01:22:35,167 --> 01:22:39,735
We are going to take this as a guess, or as a postulate

1058
01:22:41,151 --> 01:22:44,560
The Hamiltonian is just going to be proportional to the component of the spin

1059
01:22:45,639 --> 01:22:49,970
along the z axis times something proportional to the magnetic field 

1060
01:22:50,672 --> 01:22:53,627
I'm not going to write out, it contains electric charge

1061
01:22:53,852 --> 01:22:56,422
It contains a magnetic moment, it contains magnetic field 

1062
01:22:57,293 --> 01:22:59,405
But let's just call the coefficient here 

1063
01:23:00,211 --> 01:23:02,330
Let's call it omega over two

1064
01:23:03,542 --> 01:23:05,633
That's a definition of omega if you like 

1065
01:23:07,273 --> 01:23:12,635
Whatever the right combination of magnetic field, charge, magnetic moment

1066
01:23:13,078 --> 01:23:15,808
Make the particular charge, magnetic field 

1067
01:23:16,118 --> 01:23:18,427
would lump them up and call it sigma over two

1068
01:23:19,756 --> 01:23:21,302
Sorry omega over two

1069
01:23:21,689 --> 01:23:24,681
The reason for the omega would become clear shortly

1070
01:23:25,113 --> 01:23:26,189
Sorry the reason for the two, 

1071
01:23:26,823 --> 01:23:29,095
both the omega and the two will be conclude shortly

1072
01:23:29,918 --> 01:23:32,740
Okay now what I want to calculate 

1073
01:23:32,964 --> 01:23:34,425
What I want to calculate, I want to calculate 

1074
01:23:34,623 --> 01:23:40,094
the time derivative of the averages of all the components of the spin

1075
01:23:41,797 --> 01:23:46,192
Here we have the z component in the Hamiltonian

1076
01:23:46,474 --> 01:23:49,167
But I want to find out how all the components

1077
01:23:49,522 --> 01:23:53,986
Sigma x sigma y and sigma z, how they vary with time

1078
01:23:55,324 --> 01:23:59,142
So in particular I want to calculate the time derivative

1079
01:23:59,386 --> 01:24:03,426
Dot for time derivative of sigma x sigma y and sigma z

1080
01:24:04,527 --> 01:24:06,851
What was the rule? I'm afraid the rule is erased

1081
01:24:07,414 --> 01:24:08,774
But I think you probably remember it 

1082
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:16,377
The time, by definition now, this means the average of sigma x right

1083
01:24:17,408 --> 01:24:23,681
I'm not going to bother writing the bra-ket angular bracket there

1084
01:24:24,963 --> 01:24:29,539
We are now talking about the averages of sigma x sigma y and sigma z

1085
01:24:30,277 --> 01:24:32,379
And the time derivatives of the averages 

1086
01:24:33,418 --> 01:24:40,663
Alright if you remember, this is equal to minus i times the commutator of sigma x

1087
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:44,227
with the Hamiltonian right?

1088
01:24:45,668 --> 01:24:51,640
So the Hamiltonian is sigma z, and we get another factor of omega over two

1089
01:24:53,340 --> 01:24:55,496
Ya, that's correct

1090
01:24:57,636 --> 01:25:08,210
Likewise here, sigma y with sigma z times omega over two

1091
01:25:08,778 --> 01:25:14,747
And likewise here, sigma z sigma z

1092
01:25:20,332 --> 01:25:21,811
Now one of these is very easy

1093
01:25:22,083 --> 01:25:23,099
Which is the easy one?

1094
01:25:24,414 --> 01:25:28,028
The bottom one, everything commutes with itself right?

1095
01:25:28,568 --> 01:25:30,958
Everything commutes with itself

1096
01:25:31,239 --> 01:25:33,842
So this is zero and what does it tells us?

1097
01:25:34,106 --> 01:25:38,908
It tells us the component of the spin along the magnetic field

1098
01:25:40,561 --> 01:25:42,842
The average of it does not change with time 

1099
01:25:43,904 --> 01:25:48,060
That also tells us, if we are doing classical physics, which we are not

1100
01:25:48,455 --> 01:25:54,506
If we are doing classical physics, it will tell us the angle of the little vector here

1101
01:25:55,034 --> 01:25:56,457
With the magnetic field stay the same

1102
01:25:56,602 --> 01:25:58,123
But we are not

1103
01:25:58,486 --> 01:25:59,612
We just take this for what it says

1104
01:26:00,485 --> 01:26:04,051
It says that z component doesn't change with time, the average 

1105
01:26:09,427 --> 01:26:10,708
So that's the first thing we discovered

1106
01:26:12,012 --> 01:26:16,288
Now to go beyond this, we have to know what the commutation relations are

1107
01:26:17,059 --> 01:26:17,846
Of the sigmas

1108
01:26:18,745 --> 01:26:21,244
Let's work them out, I think we have enough time

1109
01:26:22,263 --> 01:26:25,453
Let's work out the commutation relation of the sigma-s 

1110
01:26:27,259 --> 01:26:32,161
All pairs of them, see what we can get, and then plug it into here

1111
01:26:52,174 --> 01:26:54,271
I'm gonna start with sigma x sigma z

1112
01:26:54,916 --> 01:26:56,816
But instead I'm gonna do the opposite way

1113
01:26:57,067 --> 01:27:00,731
I'm gonna calculate sigma z sigma x

1114
01:27:02,208 --> 01:27:04,187
It's the same thing except with the minus sign

1115
01:27:04,753 --> 01:27:06,030
If you interchange with two of them

1116
01:27:06,249 --> 01:27:06,834
So you have to remember 

1117
01:27:07,852 --> 01:27:09,464
I'm calculating sigma z sigma x

1118
01:27:10,468 --> 01:27:11,859
We will have to remember the change of sign

1119
01:27:13,391 --> 01:27:16,105
Okay so what is this? This is the product, 

1120
01:27:16,704 --> 01:27:19,121
now anybody remember what sigma z is as a matrix?

1121
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:20,344
We are going to do it now as matrices 

1122
01:27:21,531 --> 01:27:23,421
and say the way to calculate this is to remember 

1123
01:27:24,256 --> 01:27:27,136
the sigma z and sigma x are matrices

1124
01:27:27,468 --> 01:27:28,918
or at least they have a matrix representation

1125
01:27:29,932 --> 01:27:32,060
and we just have to multiply the matrices

1126
01:27:32,902 --> 01:27:36,134
sigma z, what was that? That was one zero

1127
01:27:36,670 --> 01:27:38,853
one, sorry, one, minus one

1128
01:27:43,301 --> 01:27:44,268
And what about sigma x?

1129
01:27:46,191 --> 01:27:48,831
That's zero one one zero

1130
01:27:49,479 --> 01:27:52,626
That's the first term in the commutator, sigma z times sigma x

1131
01:27:53,683 --> 01:27:57,414
And then the other term is just to put them in the opposite order

1132
01:27:58,708 --> 01:28:08,252
Zero one, one zero, times one zero, zero minus one

1133
01:28:08,631 --> 01:28:10,080
>> These operations would not (inaudible)?

1134
01:28:11,913 --> 01:28:17,965
No, we just take the commutators of the matrices as what it comes down to

1135
01:28:21,130 --> 01:28:26,664
We could do it without the matrices, just by applying the operators to the vectors

1136
01:28:27,155 --> 01:28:28,663
The vectors up and down and 

1137
01:28:28,953 --> 01:28:32,056
we know enough to actually do that without actually using the matrices 

1138
01:28:32,906 --> 01:28:37,216
But the matrices are very convenient tool for manipulating operators

1139
01:28:38,266 --> 01:28:41,999
Operator product is the same as matrix product

1140
01:28:43,413 --> 01:28:46,173
So everybody knows how to do a matrix product? I hope so

1141
01:28:47,307 --> 01:28:48,457
Let's do this one over here

1142
01:28:50,557 --> 01:28:55,570
The upper left hand corner is the product of this row with this column

1143
01:28:56,102 --> 01:28:57,976
One time zero, zero time one is zero

1144
01:28:59,482 --> 01:29:03,369
The upper right corner is the product of this row with this column

1145
01:29:03,868 --> 01:29:05,236
One times one zero, zero one

1146
01:29:06,506 --> 01:29:11,838
The lower left corner is the product of this row with this column

1147
01:29:12,156 --> 01:29:16,126
That's minus one and then the last one is this row

1148
01:29:16,641 --> 01:29:22,457
Sorry this column times this row, zero times one and sorry no

1149
01:29:23,781 --> 01:29:25,993
Zero to this one, this one is still zero

1150
01:29:28,690 --> 01:29:31,018
Okay now let's do the other one over here

1151
01:29:31,936 --> 01:29:40,005
Minus, zero times one, this one times this one is zero

1152
01:29:41,020 --> 01:29:43,009
This one times this one, minus one

1153
01:29:43,716 --> 01:29:46,239
This one times this one, one, zero

1154
01:29:47,671 --> 01:29:53,945
Uh, I think I missed the sign somewhere 

1155
01:30:06,870 --> 01:30:08,415
No no, that's right, that's right

1156
01:30:09,201 --> 01:30:16,595
This is plus, minus, okay so this we just gave the same thing

1157
01:30:18,707 --> 01:30:20,724
But with a minus sign sorry

1158
01:30:21,469 --> 01:30:26,088
This minus this gave two term which add

1159
01:30:27,028 --> 01:30:30,821
So the commutator is just equal to the commutator itself

1160
01:30:31,854 --> 01:30:38,016
It's just equal to zero one, no, it's equal to twice minus one zero

1161
01:30:40,713 --> 01:30:43,401
Now do you recognize this thing over here

1162
01:30:46,211 --> 01:30:52,554
If I put an i, an i over here, you might recognize it as being related to sigma y

1163
01:30:53,997 --> 01:30:55,170
Let me write down sigma y

1164
01:30:55,713 --> 01:31:00,939
Sigma y is equal to minus i, i zero zero 

1165
01:31:02,946 --> 01:31:06,102
Then what happens if we multiply sigma i by i

1166
01:31:08,942 --> 01:31:17,444
i times minus i is one, and i times i is minus one

1167
01:31:18,332 --> 01:31:23,157
So what this is, it's just twice i sigma y

1168
01:31:25,447 --> 01:31:26,842
Two i sigma y

1169
01:31:28,276 --> 01:31:30,792
That's kind of neat, it's closing up on itself 

1170
01:31:31,951 --> 01:31:34,536
Commutator of sigma with sigma is sigma, that's good

1171
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:40,364
Because it's going to allow me to write equations for the time derivative of sigma

1172
01:31:40,619 --> 01:31:41,778
Which is just gonna be sigma-s again

1173
01:31:43,136 --> 01:31:49,788
Okay so let's see what we have, we have commutator sigma z with sigma x

1174
01:31:51,260 --> 01:31:56,565
is equal to twice i sigma y, and now I will write down the rest of them

1175
01:31:57,368 --> 01:32:00,051
Incidentally, as I said, if you want to get the opposite order 

1176
01:32:00,324 --> 01:32:01,375
you just change the sign

1177
01:32:02,162 --> 01:32:08,660
Sigma z sigma x with sigma y is equal to two i sigma z

1178
01:32:10,364 --> 01:32:16,793
And z, x, y sigma y, x, y, z sigma z

1179
01:32:17,918 --> 01:32:19,915
It's equal to two i sigma x

1180
01:32:24,592 --> 01:32:26,150
These are the three commutations

1181
01:32:26,481 --> 01:32:27,605
Does this remind you of anything?

1182
01:32:31,386 --> 01:32:34,009
Do you remember the Poisson brackets for angular momentum?

1183
01:32:36,255 --> 01:32:41,387
The Poisson brackets of angular momentum were L z L x equals L y

1184
01:32:41,812 --> 01:32:44,586
L x L y equals to L z

1185
01:32:45,050 --> 01:32:46,665
And L y L z is equal to L x

1186
01:32:47,772 --> 01:32:49,705
So apart from the fact there is two i

1187
01:32:49,988 --> 01:32:51,691
Remember there is an i in the connection 

1188
01:32:51,928 --> 01:32:56,551
between Poisson brackets and commutators

1189
01:32:57,546 --> 01:33:01,217
These are essentially apart from the fact of two, which can be absorbed

1190
01:33:01,504 --> 01:33:05,257
Then essentially angular momentums are Poisson brackets

1191
01:33:08,250 --> 01:33:11,470
That's an important clue there for the meaning of angular momentum 

1192
01:33:12,816 --> 01:33:14,910
But we are not gonna dwell on it for the moment 

1193
01:33:15,841 --> 01:33:22,457
These are the commutation relations of the component of the spin

1194
01:33:23,795 --> 01:33:26,707
And they just give back the component of the spin again

1195
01:33:28,152 --> 01:33:33,186
With this funny ordering, z x y, x y z, y z x

1196
01:33:33,780 --> 01:33:35,357
I just permute it secretly

1197
01:33:36,373 --> 01:33:37,793
Okay so let's go over to here now 

1198
01:33:38,631 --> 01:33:45,222
This now becomes minus i omega over two 

1199
01:33:46,495 --> 01:33:49,152
And what's the commutator of sigma x with sigma z

1200
01:33:51,463 --> 01:33:53,871
It's minus two i sigma y

1201
01:33:55,197 --> 01:33:59,696
So we get another minus two i sigma y

1202
01:34:03,114 --> 01:34:04,648
With two-s cancelled, 

1203
01:34:05,154 --> 01:34:08,538
that was the reason that I put a two in the denominator here in the first place

1204
01:34:09,375 --> 01:34:10,828
cause I knew it's gonna cancelled 

1205
01:34:12,185 --> 01:34:18,747
So let's cancel the two, and we have minus i times minus i which is minus one

1206
01:34:20,376 --> 01:34:24,880
So what we get is minus omega sigma y

1207
01:34:26,503 --> 01:34:31,138
Notice that the i went away, the i went away

1208
01:34:31,528 --> 01:34:34,940
I was worried about it, about half an hour ago

1209
01:34:35,771 --> 01:34:40,848
Oh my goddess, time derivatives of real things are gonna get imaginary

1210
01:34:41,258 --> 01:34:42,271
But they didn't, they didn't 

1211
01:34:42,628 --> 01:34:46,399
because the commutators themselves has imaginary coefficients

1212
01:34:47,179 --> 01:34:51,192
And that's general, that's general, okay

1213
01:34:51,845 --> 01:35:00,683
So there we are, we have sigma x dot is equal to minus omega sigma y

1214
01:35:05,873 --> 01:35:11,916
And sigma y dot, here we have the relationship for some sigma y

1215
01:35:12,465 --> 01:35:14,532
And it involves twice sigma x

1216
01:35:15,503 --> 01:35:18,057
The correct relationship we've worked it out is that

1217
01:35:18,366 --> 01:35:22,684
This is equal to plus omega sigma x

1218
01:35:27,338 --> 01:35:32,685
Okay so sigma z dot is zero, but what's happening to sigma x and sigma y

1219
01:35:33,121 --> 01:35:34,927
Can you see what's happening with sigma x and sigma y?

1220
01:35:37,171 --> 01:35:38,915
Do you recognize this, these equations?

1221
01:35:44,140 --> 01:35:48,462
These are the equations for a thing moving in circular motion right?

1222
01:35:50,248 --> 01:35:57,218
What's happening is simple, the x in the sense of expectation values

1223
01:35:57,845 --> 01:36:00,003
Expectation values are real numbers 

1224
01:36:00,936 --> 01:36:03,279
And the sense of expectation values

1225
01:36:04,446 --> 01:36:09,879
The spin vector is processing around the z axis

1226
01:36:10,641 --> 01:36:12,351
It's processing around the z axis

1227
01:36:12,759 --> 01:36:14,826
Sigma x dot is minus omega sigma y

1228
01:36:15,187 --> 01:36:17,221
Sigma y is plus omega sigma x

1229
01:36:18,849 --> 01:36:24,145
This is the same kind of formula that we discovered in classical mechanics 

1230
01:36:24,380 --> 01:36:26,342
That we talked about a roller

1231
01:36:26,941 --> 01:36:31,610
We also put the roader in the magnetic field, the angular momentum 

1232
01:36:32,345 --> 01:36:35,360
Executed exactly the same, and it's also the gyroscope procession 

1233
01:36:36,051 --> 01:36:37,519
It's basically gyroscopic procession

1234
01:36:39,111 --> 01:36:43,528
The spin, the quantum mechanical spin in the sense of expectation values 

1235
01:36:45,213 --> 01:36:48,429
It doesn't make any sense to say that the quantum mechanical operators

1236
01:36:48,785 --> 01:36:51,195
themselves are processed, that doesn't mean anything

1237
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:54,417
Quantum mechanical operators are just these matrices 

1238
01:36:54,697 --> 01:36:55,534
They don't do anything

1239
01:36:56,245 --> 01:36:58,537
But because the state vector change with time 

1240
01:36:59,379 --> 01:37:03,321
The expectation value or the average value of the spin

1241
01:37:04,076 --> 01:37:09,987
Executed motion which is basically the same as a classical roader

1242
01:37:10,693 --> 01:37:13,892
Processing a magnetic field, okay?

1243
01:37:14,660 --> 01:37:20,591
So we have now solve the problem of a spin in the magnetic field

1244
01:37:20,850 --> 01:37:24,413
We solved the hardest possible problem associated with a single spin

1245
01:37:26,380 --> 01:37:30,316
There is no Hamiltonian which is more complicated than this for a single spin

1246
01:37:30,842 --> 01:37:35,494
It's the more general, of course you could put the magnetic field in the x direction

1247
01:37:35,845 --> 01:37:38,121
That's a little, yes you could solve a harder problem 

1248
01:37:41,285 --> 01:37:46,364
You could put the spin along some peculiar axis 

1249
01:37:47,096 --> 01:37:49,290
But what you would find after you work the whole thing out

1250
01:37:49,571 --> 01:37:52,474
is it just process around a peculiar axis of the magnetic field 

1251
01:37:53,225 --> 01:37:54,261
Same thing it just rotated 

1252
01:37:54,599 --> 01:37:58,941
so that the magnetic field is pointing at different direction

1253
01:38:00,025 --> 01:38:02,849
What's that?

1254
01:38:03,448 --> 01:38:07,140
>> any () can be described by Hamiltonian?

1255
01:38:07,578 --> 01:38:09,419
There really aren't many operators 

1256
01:38:10,194 --> 01:38:15,139
Okay so let's just, here's a general, you could work this out yourself

1257
01:38:15,366 --> 01:38:16,282
This is not hard to prove

1258
01:38:19,477 --> 01:38:24,972
The most general Hermitian operator in two dimensions 

1259
01:38:25,902 --> 01:38:29,432
is a linear combination of the unit operator 

1260
01:38:32,803 --> 01:38:36,944
sigma x sigma y and sigma z, the most general Hermitian operator

1261
01:38:37,766 --> 01:38:39,512
is a linear combination of these

1262
01:38:40,662 --> 01:38:43,501
Putting a unit operator into a Hamiltonian 

1263
01:38:43,873 --> 01:38:45,983
That's like adding a constant to the energy

1264
01:38:46,850 --> 01:38:48,859
Unit operators commute with everything 

1265
01:38:50,069 --> 01:38:53,185
So putting a unit operator in is not interesting

1266
01:38:53,649 --> 01:38:55,557
It does nothing, so we get rid of this

1267
01:38:56,790 --> 01:38:59,617
The next possibility is a general combination

1268
01:39:00,018 --> 01:39:03,648
A linear combination add them up, of coefficient times sigma x

1269
01:39:03,928 --> 01:39:06,940
another coefficient times sigma y and another coefficient times sigma z

1270
01:39:08,634 --> 01:39:13,303
That just correspond to putting the magnetic field of some angle

1271
01:39:14,744 --> 01:39:20,016
It just, the simple case where we only took one of these

1272
01:39:22,658 --> 01:39:26,234
It's the magnetic field along the z axis

1273
01:39:27,022 --> 01:39:28,980
If we took a general linearly combination 

1274
01:39:29,995 --> 01:39:37,026
Let's say n sub x sigma x plus n sub y sigma y, plus n sub z sigma z

1275
01:39:38,123 --> 01:39:42,385
This will just correspond to the component of the spin along the n axis

1276
01:39:43,628 --> 01:39:46,339
And you would do exactly the same calculation 

1277
01:39:46,928 --> 01:39:53,468
except you might work instead in the basis of eigenvectors of sigma dot n

1278
01:39:54,204 --> 01:39:58,782
So it really is the general Hamiltonian that you can write down

1279
01:39:59,158 --> 01:40:02,612
And that just because a two-dimensional space is so simple

1280
01:40:03,169 --> 01:40:05,949
It's just on very independent operators in it

1281
01:40:09,290 --> 01:40:10,375
It just does nothing else 

1282
01:40:13,631 --> 01:40:17,702
>> The two-dimensional space is the space of states

1283
01:40:18,616 --> 01:40:22,055
>> but sort of things in three-dimensional space in the procession

1284
01:40:22,378 --> 01:40:28,600
Right, but we work, ya, but remember for every direction you can think of

1285
01:40:28,965 --> 01:40:34,896
There is a state for which that component of the spin is definite 

1286
01:40:36,214 --> 01:40:39,278
But that's secondary here, we are not 

1287
01:40:39,539 --> 01:40:42,010
That didn't play very much a role here, which just follow the rules

1288
01:40:43,590 --> 01:40:48,289
And yes, I mean there are two things going on here

1289
01:40:49,564 --> 01:40:51,883
And this is a good place to focus on those two things

1290
01:40:52,304 --> 01:40:55,120
There are the three-vectors, the vectors in real space 

1291
01:40:55,712 --> 01:40:57,884
Those are the components of the average of sigma

1292
01:40:58,950 --> 01:41:02,094
And there is a two-dimensional space of state and they're quite different things

1293
01:41:03,724 --> 01:41:04,632
Although they are related 

1294
01:41:10,121 --> 01:41:11,710
>> Does it make a represented 

1295
01:41:16,176 --> 01:41:20,501
omega is basically the magnetic field times the magnetic moment of the little spin

1296
01:41:24,034 --> 01:41:27,100
Maybe of two I have to remember, but no I don't think

1297
01:41:27,386 --> 01:41:29,896
Ya, there is a two, ya

1298
01:41:31,150 --> 01:41:35,687
Omega over two is the product of magnetic moment with the magnetic field

1299
01:41:37,377 --> 01:41:42,812
>> Our original technique for creating a sigma z was to 

1300
01:41:43,132 --> 01:41:46,321
>> put it in a magnetic field and have a (full timer)?

1301
01:41:47,159 --> 01:41:51,447
That was, that was last year, you are right

1302
01:41:53,615 --> 01:41:57,868
>> I mean if we pursuit this and couple it to a field

1303
01:41:58,306 --> 01:41:59,890
>> we will see that

1304
01:42:00,952 --> 01:42:04,001
Ya, right, if we couple the spin, now forget the procession

1305
01:42:05,753 --> 01:42:07,665
If we couple a spin to a magnetic field 

1306
01:42:08,653 --> 01:42:10,129
Then there will be two energy states

1307
01:42:11,118 --> 01:42:13,925
For example if the magnetic field this is along the z axis

1308
01:42:14,433 --> 01:42:18,801
Then the energy of the up state and the down state would be different 

1309
01:42:19,409 --> 01:42:20,640
They will different by amount omega

1310
01:42:21,527 --> 01:42:23,440
Up will have an energy omega over two

1311
01:42:23,859 --> 01:42:25,566
Down would have the energy minus omega over two

1312
01:42:26,439 --> 01:42:28,433
And there will be an energy difference of omega 

1313
01:42:30,135 --> 01:42:31,828
Alright so one of them has higher energy

1314
01:42:32,095 --> 01:42:33,049
One of them has lower energy

1315
01:42:34,295 --> 01:42:37,479
What happens to a real spin if you wait long enough?

1316
01:42:38,738 --> 01:42:40,667
If you put it in a magnetic field 

1317
01:42:41,090 --> 01:42:45,135
The answer is eventually the higher energy state will emit a photon

1318
01:42:45,959 --> 01:42:49,660
And what will be the energy of the photon? Omega

1319
01:42:50,197 --> 01:42:52,576
Just a difference between the upper energy and the lower energy

1320
01:42:53,255 --> 01:42:55,598
And in the process of emitting the photon it will flip

1321
01:42:56,985 --> 01:43:00,036
So these things are all certainly connected

1322
01:43:03,171 --> 01:43:08,595
But alright we solved a real genuine quantum mechanic problem

1323
01:43:09,037 --> 01:43:12,753
>> So why is the B not in the operators 

1324
01:43:13,676 --> 01:43:15,839
>> Why is the magnetic field not in the operators?

1325
01:43:18,111 --> 01:43:22,977
If you are to think of the magnet as a part of quantum mechanical system

1326
01:43:23,290 --> 01:43:28,446
Whenever you are facing the problem of a real quantum system

1327
01:43:29,206 --> 01:43:34,634
which is being an interaction with a heavy system

1328
01:43:35,626 --> 01:43:40,746
With a system like a magnet or other kinds of detector

1329
01:43:41,019 --> 01:43:45,746
Almost classical system, you don't bother 

1330
01:43:46,211 --> 01:43:48,657
trying to think of the heavy system quantum mechanically 

1331
01:43:48,977 --> 01:43:53,211
That has to be justified, this is not obvious to justify 

1332
01:43:54,860 --> 01:43:57,051
Why don't we have to think of the magnet 

1333
01:43:57,319 --> 01:43:58,817
is a part of the quantum mechanical system?

1334
01:43:59,161 --> 01:44:00,719
It's another way of asking the same question

1335
01:44:02,723 --> 01:44:07,229
And the answer is it's so big and so heavy that it doesn't fluctuate much

1336
01:44:08,019 --> 01:44:10,377
But eventually we will want to address that problem

1337
01:44:11,312 --> 01:44:15,942
For the moment we just think of the magnet as a part of a heavy apparatus

1338
01:44:16,415 --> 01:44:17,695
which is sort of fixed and it's there

1339
01:44:18,030 --> 01:44:24,087
Nothing that the electron can do is gonna cause that magnetic field to change

1340
01:44:25,024 --> 01:44:30,228
It's just stuck there, and we get to think of it deterministically 

1341
01:44:30,891 --> 01:44:33,317
When do we get to think of other thing deterministically?

1342
01:44:33,985 --> 01:44:37,086
We get to think of the thing deterministically when it's so heavy

1343
01:44:38,390 --> 01:44:40,763
And so many degrees of freedom

1344
01:44:41,544 --> 01:44:44,446
That when we calculate the quantum mechanics of it

1345
01:44:44,739 --> 01:44:46,472
We find that the fluctuation is really small

1346
01:44:46,941 --> 01:44:48,703
But that's nothing established yet

1347
01:44:49,865 --> 01:44:54,180
So far we divided the world into the quantum and the apparatuses

1348
01:44:54,539 --> 01:44:57,624
The heavy apparatus we don't have to deal with quantum mechanically 

1349
01:44:57,982 --> 01:44:59,457
That of course is a temporary thing 

1350
01:45:00,499 --> 01:45:03,930
Real apparatus is made of the same thing as the system we study

1351
01:45:05,322 --> 01:45:06,881
And at some point we have to come back and say

1352
01:45:07,183 --> 01:45:14,854
What was the justification for saying the apparatus was allowed to be consider

1353
01:45:15,303 --> 01:45:17,786
just classically, you just point it in some direction

1354
01:45:18,288 --> 01:45:19,414
And that's the way it is

1355
01:45:19,828 --> 01:45:22,268
And the spin dealt with quantum mechanically

1356
01:45:22,624 --> 01:45:23,841
We will have to come back and answer that 

1357
01:45:24,754 --> 01:45:30,399
But you know my usual statement at this point is not tonight

1358
01:45:33,340 --> 01:45:41,219
>> sigma x, sigma y, those are average values?

1359
01:45:44,541 --> 01:45:49,132
>> if we repeat the experiment a zillion time, would it

1360
01:45:49,631 --> 01:45:55,713
>> if we repeat the experiment a zillion time, would it change or fail?

1361
01:45:56,155 --> 01:45:57,293
No unpredictable manner 

1362
01:46:01,913 --> 01:46:04,350
Yes the answer is yes, it will occasionally fail

1363
01:46:06,533 --> 01:46:08,516
But that has little to do with quantum mechanics 

1364
01:46:09,158 --> 01:46:10,459
Well it has to do with quantum mechanics 

1365
01:46:11,519 --> 01:46:14,915
But it has to do with the use of statistics and probability

1366
01:46:15,304 --> 01:46:16,592
Why is probability work?

1367
01:46:17,468 --> 01:46:21,773
We make a basic postulate, and that's if you do an experiment over enough time

1368
01:46:23,959 --> 01:46:29,618
The average value that you get in a laboratory will agree with in small precision

1369
01:46:30,550 --> 01:46:32,270
With the mathematical averages 

1370
01:46:32,662 --> 01:46:34,525
that you calculate from a probability distribution

1371
01:46:36,345 --> 01:46:38,573
I am not going to try to justify that 

1372
01:46:39,093 --> 01:46:40,713
The reason is I don't know what is true

1373
01:46:44,068 --> 01:46:45,932
And why does probability work?

1374
01:46:46,634 --> 01:46:50,269
Why, if I tell you, if you flip a coin a thousand times

1375
01:46:52,424 --> 01:46:55,098
Does it come up heads of five hundred times? No

1376
01:46:55,891 --> 01:46:57,028
There is no such prediction

1377
01:46:58,077 --> 01:47:00,520
Certainly I mean it might come up five hundred times heads

1378
01:47:01,757 --> 01:47:03,527
But there is not prediction that says it does 

1379
01:47:05,215 --> 01:47:07,588
Will it come up five hundred times plus or minus?

1380
01:47:08,114 --> 01:47:10,462
Square root of a thousand? Plus or minus thirty?

1381
01:47:10,877 --> 01:47:14,259
That's the margin of error, not every time, no

1382
01:47:14,567 --> 01:47:15,630
So there is no such prediction

1383
01:47:16,711 --> 01:47:19,189
What can you say? You could probably come up 

1384
01:47:21,119 --> 01:47:23,529
You know we are getting into a cycle

1385
01:47:24,544 --> 01:47:27,301
How about if I do a million times, it will certainly come up 

1386
01:47:29,094 --> 01:47:31,510
five hundred thousand plus or minus square root of them?

1387
01:47:31,850 --> 01:47:33,946
No, no matter how many times you do it

1388
01:47:34,303 --> 01:47:39,156
There is no hard and fast prediction from probability that

1389
01:47:39,485 --> 01:47:40,779
any particular thing will happen

1390
01:47:42,357 --> 01:47:44,767
Why does it work? Jesus, that beats me 

1391
01:47:48,565 --> 01:47:49,692
But it does

1392
01:47:51,732 --> 01:47:54,550
You know I'm not the only one that have been puzzled by this

1393
01:47:54,958 --> 01:47:57,453
I mean, you know, I used to like to joke that 

1394
01:47:57,841 --> 01:48:01,709
This is probably the reason that Einstein didn't like quantum mechanics

1395
01:48:06,149 --> 01:48:07,278
>>

1396
01:48:10,793 --> 01:48:11,580
Say that again

1397
01:48:12,166 --> 01:48:16,534
>> on the floor the Psi, x, y and z

1398
01:48:18,915 --> 01:48:23,755
>>  reflected in the magnet right?

1399
01:48:27,175 --> 01:48:29,276
Now we could have done the same calculation 

1400
01:48:30,049 --> 01:48:36,134
by instead of putting an sigma z here putting sigma dot n

1401
01:48:42,070 --> 01:48:48,455
Sigma dot n is the matrix in the notation that we've been using up till now

1402
01:48:49,177 --> 01:48:51,397
With the sigma matrices that are the things that wrote down

1403
01:48:52,161 --> 01:48:59,201
It will be the matrix and there is a unit vector 

1404
01:49:00,449 --> 01:49:05,990
n sub z minus n sub z, n x minus i n y

1405
01:49:07,195 --> 01:49:13,787
and n x plus i n y, it's just taking a component of n

1406
01:49:14,977 --> 01:49:17,562
and multiplying them with the corresponding component of sigma

1407
01:49:18,696 --> 01:49:20,242
and then you could start with this and say

1408
01:49:20,537 --> 01:49:21,893
This is, put an omega over two

1409
01:49:25,727 --> 01:49:27,137
And take this to be the Hamiltonian 

1410
01:49:28,054 --> 01:49:31,609
And then recalculate what happens to the different components of spin

1411
01:49:33,671 --> 01:49:37,832
Well the component of spin along the n axis, what would we do then?

1412
01:49:38,129 --> 01:49:42,600
We will have to calculate commutators of the various components of the spin

1413
01:49:43,816 --> 01:49:46,654
With sigma dot n, sigma dot n

1414
01:49:49,795 --> 01:49:51,755
What about the component along the n axis?

1415
01:49:52,013 --> 01:49:55,810
What happens to it? The commutator zero right?

1416
01:49:56,550 --> 01:49:58,191
Sigma dot n commutes to sigma dot n

1417
01:49:59,209 --> 01:50:03,321
So we will find out that the component to the spin along the n axis

1418
01:50:04,210 --> 01:50:05,779
Would be the thing that doesn't change

1419
01:50:07,064 --> 01:50:09,976
How about the component of spin perpendicular to that axis?

1420
01:50:11,157 --> 01:50:16,959
We can work that out, and we will discover that the spin process about the n axis

1421
01:50:18,445 --> 01:50:19,754
That's a good exercise to try to do

1422
01:50:21,215 --> 01:50:27,482
>>  reflected the orientation 

1423
01:50:28,019 --> 01:50:30,289
If you want to, say that again?

1424
01:50:30,810 --> 01:50:35,729
>> I was asking what the reflected the orientation of the spin

1425
01:50:36,249 --> 01:50:39,693
>> the omega and then to dot n

1426
01:50:40,344 --> 01:50:41,489
Omega is just a number

1427
01:50:42,831 --> 01:50:46,911
>> because you flip it to dot n, if you move to dot n

1428
01:50:47,708 --> 01:50:49,991
>>(inaudible)

1429
01:50:52,733 --> 01:50:54,982
My orientation you mean Poisson minus one?

1430
01:50:56,666 --> 01:50:57,919
Or you mean direction?

1431
01:50:59,408 --> 01:51:03,967
No no no no no, omega doesn't have to do with the direction

1432
01:51:04,904 --> 01:51:08,230
Omega is just the magnitude of a magnetic field

1433
01:51:08,483 --> 01:51:13,173
Magnitude of a magnetic field times the magnitude of the magnetic moment 

1434
01:51:14,432 --> 01:51:15,599
>> the dot?

1435
01:51:16,058 --> 01:51:17,500
No dotted in they are just numbers

1436
01:51:18,001 --> 01:51:20,831
Numbers, the dot product is between sigma and n

1437
01:51:24,561 --> 01:51:28,771
Omega is just a spectator, a number, it's just a number 

1438
01:51:30,147 --> 01:51:32,301
It's just a number, or you can if you like, 

1439
01:51:32,710 --> 01:51:35,312
you can take this omega and put it with a n if you want to

1440
01:51:36,157 --> 01:51:38,645
>> (inaudible)

1441
01:51:39,338 --> 01:51:45,143
>> depends on the orientation of the spin

1442
01:51:45,481 --> 01:51:46,788
What depends on the orientation of the spin?

1443
01:51:47,494 --> 01:51:50,030
>> The energy eigenvalue H

1444
01:51:53,359 --> 01:51:55,062
One of those is confused, I'm not sure which

1445
01:51:55,650 --> 01:51:59,925
>> The confusion is we can see there the magnetic field is in the z direction?

1446
01:52:00,571 --> 01:52:02,099
Here the magnetic field is in the z direction 

1447
01:52:03,217 --> 01:52:04,309
>> omega z

1448
01:52:05,136 --> 01:52:07,062
Omega z, where do we have the omega z?

1449
01:52:07,655 --> 01:52:09,677
>> H equals omega two, sorry, sigma z

1450
01:52:10,225 --> 01:52:11,293
sigma z, yes sigma z

1451
01:52:11,573 --> 01:52:18,258
>> Where is the spatial vector of the spin vector

1452
01:52:20,831 --> 01:52:22,659
Omega (sigma) dot n means dot product

1453
01:52:32,693 --> 01:52:35,420
>> you said whenever you are talking spin

1454
01:52:36,030 --> 01:52:39,219
>> you are talking with one over two 

1455
01:52:45,653 --> 01:52:50,642
I think I read that too, I think it was Newt Gingrich last book?

1456
01:52:56,887 --> 01:53:07,108
I don't know, sigma dot n stands for sigma x n x plus sigma y n y plus sigma z n z

1457
01:53:07,600 --> 01:53:11,242
Exactly as if sigma was a classical vector 

1458
01:53:13,572 --> 01:53:15,893
But of course it's not, it's just a collection of three matrices 

1459
01:53:16,994 --> 01:53:18,234
So this stands for matrix

1460
01:53:19,467 --> 01:53:22,525
This stands for a single matrix which happens to be 

1461
01:53:23,278 --> 01:53:24,267
the sum of three particular matrices 

1462
01:53:25,315 --> 01:53:27,671
But that's definition of sigma dot n if you like

1463
01:53:28,968 --> 01:53:30,808
These are the components of n 

1464
01:53:31,139 --> 01:53:33,673
and they determine the direction of the magnetic field

1465
01:53:33,722 --> 01:53:37,239
We multiply that by omega over two which is just a number 

1466
01:53:38,014 --> 01:53:40,853
Just a number, nothing more complicated than a number

1467
01:53:42,991 --> 01:53:44,262
And this is what sigma dot n means 

1468
01:53:45,200 --> 01:53:48,281
If the magnetic field is along the z axis

1469
01:53:49,307 --> 01:53:53,399
Then the only component of n which is none zero would be n sub z

1470
01:53:55,334 --> 01:54:01,415
Okay? If the magnetic field was along the z axis then

1471
01:54:02,785 --> 01:54:05,812
We would say only n sub z

1472
01:54:07,647 --> 01:54:09,375
If you like, would you like me to write down 

1473
01:54:10,007 --> 01:54:11,335
the relationship between n and the magnetic field?

1474
01:54:12,022 --> 01:54:13,758
The relationship between n and the magnetic field

1475
01:54:15,205 --> 01:54:20,567
is that the magnetic field vector is equal to the magnitude of the magnetic field

1476
01:54:21,298 --> 01:54:23,109
times the unit vector n

1477
01:54:27,015 --> 01:54:31,491
The magnetic field as a vector was a magnitude to the magnetic field 

1478
01:54:32,068 --> 01:54:35,196
times the vecotor n, and that stands for magnetic field 

1479
01:54:35,503 --> 01:54:39,393
It's pointing along the n axis with magnitude B

1480
01:54:40,925 --> 01:54:47,909
Once we know that, then we could basically identify the magnetic field with n

1481
01:54:48,400 --> 01:54:49,192
Apart from a numerical coefficient 

1482
01:54:50,023 --> 01:54:52,168
Numerical coefficient is buried into omega here 

1483
01:54:53,696 --> 01:54:59,032
Once we know that we could write this as the spin dotted into B 

1484
01:54:59,778 --> 01:55:01,254
So I'm not sure what the questions are 

1485
01:55:01,868 --> 01:55:04,523
There is something which is bothering some of you I'm not sure what it is

1486
01:55:05,405 --> 01:55:11,948
>>  is frequency you get always the same or  

1487
01:55:14,396 --> 01:55:17,512
It depends on the magnitude of the magnetic field nothing more

1488
01:55:18,012 --> 01:55:21,139
>> 

1489
01:55:21,426 --> 01:55:22,561
You are talking about the frequency of the photon?

1490
01:55:23,671 --> 01:55:28,469
Now the frequency of the photon is always just the difference of 

1491
01:55:28,716 --> 01:55:31,799
the energy of the upper energy level and the lower energy level

1492
01:55:32,204 --> 01:55:33,921
And it's always just omega 

1493
01:55:36,488 --> 01:55:37,987
It doesn't depend on the, right

1494
01:55:40,996 --> 01:55:44,315
If you take sigma dot n and ask what it's eigenvalues are

1495
01:55:44,894 --> 01:55:46,616
The eigenvalues don't depend on n

1496
01:55:48,339 --> 01:55:50,481
They are plus or minus one in any direction

1497
01:55:53,089 --> 01:55:54,997
>> (inaudible) eigenvector?

1498
01:55:57,248 --> 01:56:01,583
The eigenvalues, let's write out, sigma dot n

1499
01:56:02,580 --> 01:56:04,573
Alright here is an exercise for you should be done

1500
01:56:06,014 --> 01:56:11,559
Sigma dot n is n sub z times sigma sub z

1501
01:56:11,844 --> 01:56:20,601
That's n z minus n z, plus n x times sigma x, that's that

1502
01:56:21,945 --> 01:56:28,485
Minus n y sigma y, that's n dot sigma 

1503
01:56:32,144 --> 01:56:35,251
Question: what are the eigenvalues of these matrices?

1504
01:56:36,056 --> 01:56:37,434
Somebody worked them out, 

1505
01:56:37,741 --> 01:56:38,923
I know somebody in this room has worked them out

1506
01:56:39,288 --> 01:56:40,416
But who was it?

1507
01:56:43,370 --> 01:56:47,901
The eigenvalues for these matrices here for any n, as long as it's the unit vectors

1508
01:56:49,205 --> 01:56:51,405
If n is the component of a unit vector 

1509
01:56:52,270 --> 01:56:57,273
Another words, n x squared plus n y squared plus n z squared is equal to one

1510
01:56:58,550 --> 01:57:02,648
You will find that the eigenvalues of these matrices are always plus or minus one

1511
01:57:03,903 --> 01:57:07,539
This is simply the statement that 

1512
01:57:07,872 --> 01:57:11,110
no matter what direction you point your detector, your apparatus

1513
01:57:12,270 --> 01:57:16,327
When the apparatus acts, it gives you plus or minus ones, okay?

1514
01:57:17,380 --> 01:57:19,736
So whatever direction you take here

1515
01:57:22,607 --> 01:57:25,626
The eigenvalues of these matrices are plus or minus one

1516
01:57:29,259 --> 01:57:31,572
If you know a little bit about matrices 

1517
01:57:32,300 --> 01:57:34,966
For those who know a little bit about matrices, let's prove it

1518
01:57:37,922 --> 01:57:40,238
The trace of the matrix is the sum of it's eigenvalues 

1519
01:57:42,141 --> 01:57:44,625
The trace means sum of the diagonal elements

1520
01:57:46,331 --> 01:57:51,042
First step, there are two eigenvalues, let's call them lambda one and lambda two

1521
01:57:51,653 --> 01:57:53,103
And the trace of the matrix is zero

1522
01:57:53,624 --> 01:57:58,267
This one plus this one, and that tells us that lambda one plus lambda two is zero

1523
01:57:58,996 --> 01:58:01,529
Or lambda one is equal to minus lambda two

1524
01:58:02,467 --> 01:58:05,066
So there are two eigenvalues and they are equal in opposite 

1525
01:58:07,109 --> 01:58:09,004
What about the determinant of the matrix?

1526
01:58:13,236 --> 01:58:14,972
It's the product of the eigenvalues 

1527
01:58:15,661 --> 01:58:18,277
So we now know they come in equal and opposite pairs 

1528
01:58:19,394 --> 01:58:22,038
What's the product? What's the determinant?

1529
01:58:22,982 --> 01:58:33,311
The determinant of this matrix is equal to minus n z squared

1530
01:58:34,256 --> 01:58:39,987
This times this, minus this times this, and that's minus n x squared

1531
01:58:40,403 --> 01:58:41,948
Minus n y squared, right?

1532
01:58:43,804 --> 01:58:48,184
n x plus i n y times n x minus i ny is n x squared plus n y squared 

1533
01:58:48,551 --> 01:58:52,458
Here it is, now what is n x squared plus ny squared plus n z squared?

1534
01:58:53,218 --> 01:58:57,152
One, so the determinant which is the product of the eigenvalues 

1535
01:58:59,105 --> 01:59:00,234
is equal to minus one

1536
01:59:03,318 --> 01:59:08,668
There is only one solution, lambda one plus lambda two is equal to zero

1537
01:59:09,967 --> 01:59:11,896
That's lambda one equals to minus lambda two

1538
01:59:12,685 --> 01:59:15,016
And the product is equal to minus one

1539
01:59:15,309 --> 01:59:17,599
There is only one such pair, it's plus one and minus one 

1540
01:59:18,861 --> 01:59:24,107
So all such matrices of these form have eigenvalues which are plus or minus one

1541
01:59:25,420 --> 01:59:32,071
And therefore the energy levels are always plus or minus omega over two 

1542
01:59:33,679 --> 01:59:36,490
One of them plus omega over two, the other minus omega over two

1543
01:59:37,415 --> 01:59:41,461
When you flip from one to the other you get omega worth of energy

1544
01:59:43,636 --> 01:59:45,204
Always so it doesn't matter which way it was pointing in

1545
01:59:46,176 --> 01:59:47,826
Ya , I think it's time to go but

1546
01:59:48,725 --> 01:59:51,293
>> the electron is  in the extra

1547
01:59:51,870 --> 01:59:55,282
>> and you put it in a magnetic field and review that 

1548
01:59:56,331 --> 01:59:59,893
>> and suddenly it has y and z direction

1549
02:00:00,688 --> 02:00:05,946
Ya ya, in studying, yes, I should have say

1550
02:00:06,225 --> 02:00:11,478
In studying the procession we ignore the possibility that it can radiate a photon

1551
02:00:12,725 --> 02:00:15,813
Now the probability to radiate a photon per unit time 

1552
02:00:17,876 --> 02:00:21,551
Can be pretty small, can be very very small

1553
02:00:22,350 --> 02:00:25,061
Particularly the energy difference is very very small, 

1554
02:00:25,379 --> 02:00:26,906
as they would be in a magnetic field 

1555
02:00:28,064 --> 02:00:31,302
It will process many many times before emits a photon

1556
02:00:32,475 --> 02:00:37,851
>> So, my question is, if it does it will emit a photon

1557
02:00:38,326 --> 02:00:41,787
>> Since it's not flipping in a whole 180 degree

1558
02:00:42,291 --> 02:00:44,332
No, go from up to down

1559
02:00:47,481 --> 02:00:52,673
Remember the two eigenvectors, the two eigenvectors up and down 

1560
02:00:53,021 --> 02:01:00,500
left and right or in and out, correspond to opposite orientation of the spin

1561
02:01:01,189 --> 02:01:03,809
Even though the state vectors are orthogonal 

1562
02:01:04,525 --> 02:01:07,839
The directions in space are 180 degrees apart

1563
02:01:11,441 --> 02:01:13,859
>> So this imaginary situation that 

1564
02:01:18,406 --> 02:01:19,876
>> What is was doing to orthogonal 

1565
02:01:23,199 --> 02:01:28,497
Well okay, there is a probability for the electron to decay

1566
02:01:29,212 --> 02:01:35,476
And emit a photon, and that probability per unit time is typically small

1567
02:01:36,451 --> 02:01:39,749
So you could be unlucky and after a quarter of evolution 

1568
02:01:40,371 --> 02:01:41,329
It might emit a photon

1569
02:01:42,535 --> 02:01:46,000
But that's extremely unlikely, you can estimate, 

1570
02:01:46,336 --> 02:01:49,080
Am I answering your question, I'm not sure

1571
02:01:49,961 --> 02:01:52,896
>> No I really is  would it be either in the direction 

1572
02:01:53,314 --> 02:01:58,031
>> it was going to a flipped opposite and suddenly goes other way

1573
02:01:58,970 --> 02:02:00,807
>> like from x y to z

1574
02:02:01,733 --> 02:02:02,784
>>I think the question is

1575
02:02:03,252 --> 02:02:10,197
>> It appears that if the electron is not perfectly fit into the magnetic field

1576
02:02:14,727 --> 02:02:18,332
No, no no, it's in a superposition of being up and down

1577
02:02:19,001 --> 02:02:20,396
It's one or two of those 

1578
02:02:20,775 --> 02:02:24,431
It's only the average which is sort of in that direction 

1579
02:02:25,957 --> 02:02:28,543
It's in a superposition of being up and down

1580
02:02:30,441 --> 02:02:34,448
If it's down and down is the lower energy state it wont radiate

1581
02:02:35,378 --> 02:02:39,737
If it's up it will radiate, so you put the electron to some other direction

1582
02:02:40,720 --> 02:02:42,661
There will be some probability for it to radiate

1583
02:02:43,093 --> 02:02:44,656
And the probability for it to not radiate

1584
02:02:45,107 --> 02:02:50,684
The probability for it to radiate is the probability that it was up, ya

1585
02:02:52,100 --> 02:02:55,797
Very confusing, very confusing, alright

1586
02:02:58,315 --> 02:03:00,221
Okay now I knew what was bothering you

1587
02:03:01,504 --> 02:03:02,872
If the magnetic field is that way

1588
02:03:03,882 --> 02:03:05,353
And the spin is aligned that way

1589
02:03:06,197 --> 02:03:08,297
You might have thought that when it jumps 

1590
02:03:08,550 --> 02:03:10,927
you only emit half the energy of the photon

1591
02:03:12,156 --> 02:03:13,651
Half the energy, no, 

1592
02:03:15,406 --> 02:03:20,240
what's correct is that the probability for it to emit a photon is one half

1593
02:03:21,342 --> 02:03:24,573
Why? Because it has half a probability this is actually down

1594
02:03:24,981 --> 02:03:26,346
And half a probability that is up

1595
02:03:26,643 --> 02:03:28,740
If you are to measure the up-ness and down-ness of it

1596
02:03:29,594 --> 02:03:34,087
So that means the average energy that it emits is half

1597
02:03:35,692 --> 02:03:40,837
But it either emits omega or it doesn't emit at all okay

1598
02:03:41,749 --> 02:03:45,066
