1
00:00:05,586 --> 00:00:08,383
Stanford University

2
00:00:08,626 --> 00:00:13,132
Alright  we start to explore entanglement

3
00:00:13,239 --> 00:00:19,491
I had actually started to think about doing Bell's theorem  this  tonight

4
00:00:19,563 --> 00:00:25,394
But I decided not to do it yet

5
00:00:25,624 --> 00:00:29,686
It's a complicate story  it  the Bell's theorem

6
00:00:29,867 --> 00:00:31,777
It's very lovely

7
00:00:31,956 --> 00:00:36,735
But more important thing that the theorem itself is what it says

8
00:00:36,874 --> 00:00:42,615
So I wanted to get as much as possible tonight to what it says

9
00:00:42,753 --> 00:00:50,522
And what entanglement has to tell us about the nature of systems

10
00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:53,828
Sometimes people say the nature of reality

11
00:00:53,931 --> 00:00:55,624
I don't like the word reality

12
00:00:55,767 --> 00:00:59,391
I think it's misleading

13
00:00:59,499 --> 00:01:06,458
Ok  um  if you look on the Internet

14
00:01:06,532 --> 00:01:10,405
And the messages you guys send back and forth

15
00:01:10,513 --> 00:01:12,542
They are very interesting

16
00:01:12,685 --> 00:01:16,597
many of them have some very interesting points of them

17
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,436
There is terminology which I would discourage

18
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,864
at least you know what I mean with greater precession

19
00:01:24,003 --> 00:01:26,511
And I see that's all over the place

20
00:01:26,621 --> 00:01:28,906
People say entanglement a share

21
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:33,168
when two quantum system share the same sharing state

22
00:01:33,275 --> 00:01:37,224
I never understood what that means to share a state

23
00:01:37,372 --> 00:01:41,748
Um  quantum systems have states

24
00:01:41,896 --> 00:01:45,969
If they are composite quantum systems  they have states

25
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:48,367
You can say that quantum systems

26
00:01:48,477 --> 00:01:49,389
a pair of quantum systems

27
00:01:49,502 --> 00:01:53,602
when they make giving quantum systems share a state if you like

28
00:01:53,712 --> 00:01:56,277
But it just means a state of composite system

29
00:01:56,419 --> 00:02:02,632
The important idea about entanglement

30
00:02:02,735 --> 00:02:06,044
is not so much that systems share a state

31
00:02:06,154 --> 00:02:07,551
That they always do

32
00:02:07,697 --> 00:02:14,145
It's the important thing that they are not described by a product state

33
00:02:14,292 --> 00:02:19,072
A product state being a state in which the wavefunction of the system

34
00:02:19,178 --> 00:02:19,999
And we will talk about wave

35
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,638
Have we talked about wavefunctions very much?

36
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:23,632
I don't think we have

37
00:02:23,779 --> 00:02:27,148
Let's begin by talking about wavefunctions

38
00:02:27,252 --> 00:02:30,791
And then I want to move the concept of density matrix

39
00:02:30,946 --> 00:02:35,188
This would make it much easier for us to think about entanglement

40
00:02:35,296 --> 00:02:37,628
First of all  notion of wavefunction

41
00:02:37,735 --> 00:02:45,645
A wavefunction may or may not have anything to do with waves

42
00:02:45,795 --> 00:02:54,506
The concept grew historically out of the quantum mechanics of particles

43
00:02:54,646 --> 00:02:58,896
and relation of probability description of them in terms of waves

44
00:02:59,042 --> 00:03:04,574
but the  the logical concept of a wavefunction

45
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:07,757
is one that you can apply to any quantum system

46
00:03:07,902 --> 00:03:09,500
and in general it doesn't have to do

47
00:03:09,607 --> 00:03:12,796
with wave motion of any particular kind

48
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:16,907
The basic idea of a wavefunction is following

49
00:03:17,012 --> 00:03:18,542
You have a quantum state

50
00:03:18,649 --> 00:03:31,797
Let's call the quantum state  capital Psi

51
00:03:31,868 --> 00:03:38,806
I'll use the letter capital Psi to denote a generic quantum state of the system

52
00:03:38,911 --> 00:03:41,385
I think previously I've been using As Bs

53
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:44,177
But I am starting to use Psi

54
00:03:44,322 --> 00:03:47,795
As a generic quantum state  pretty much any system

55
00:03:47,899 --> 00:03:51,959
and also I have a basis system

56
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,174
The basis system is typically labeled

57
00:03:55,242 --> 00:03:59,330
by a collection of eigenvalues of something

58
00:03:59,471 --> 00:04:05,512
It might be labeled by one or more variables

59
00:04:05,653 --> 00:04:10,457
If there are several commuting operators in the system

60
00:04:10,566 --> 00:04:15,790
you can specify simultaneously the eigenvalues of more than one thing

61
00:04:15,933 --> 00:04:18,927
and in many cases  you want to do that

62
00:04:19,038 --> 00:04:21,795
In the basis vectors in those cases are labeled

63
00:04:21,935 --> 00:04:24,927
by a collection of observables

64
00:04:25,115 --> 00:04:29,775
or collection of eigenvalues of perhaps several quantities

65
00:04:29,929 --> 00:04:31,300
I'll give you an example

66
00:04:31,411 --> 00:04:38,119
If you're talking about the motion of a particle

67
00:04:38,265 --> 00:04:45,181
then the X and Y and Z coordinates of a particle are commuting variables

68
00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:48,404
The things that don't commute are the components of momentum

69
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,889
with the components of position

70
00:04:49,963 --> 00:04:51,168
I know we haven't done this yet

71
00:04:51,276 --> 00:04:54,962
But the other hand

72
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:58,434
the three components of positional commute with each other

73
00:04:58,481 --> 00:05:02,764
That means they can be specified simultaneously

74
00:05:02,872 --> 00:05:07,485
A useful basis for studying the quantum mechanics of a particle

75
00:05:07,593 --> 00:05:13,972
is a basis which is labeled by the three coordinates of the particle

76
00:05:20,113 --> 00:05:26,408
We've  I'll give a hand

77
00:05:26,516 --> 00:05:28,339
Alright  so we have a basis

78
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:33,660
And the basis is labeled by a collection of eigenvalues

79
00:05:33,736 --> 00:05:35,176
Let's labeled them

80
00:05:35,283 --> 00:05:36,918
This don't have a decent pen

81
00:05:37,022 --> 00:05:42,068
Alright  a b c  however many commuting variables

82
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:50,814
there are that need to be specified in order to specify a system

83
00:05:50,924 --> 00:05:55,842
and the inner product of the basis vector

84
00:05:55,947 --> 00:05:59,966
with the state of the system itself is called the wave function

85
00:06:00,112 --> 00:06:05,570
In fact we can write that psi since these objects here form a basis

86
00:06:05,677 --> 00:06:08,989
we can say that this is a sum

87
00:06:09,098 --> 00:06:12,979
I still don't have a decent pen?

88
00:06:13,084 --> 00:06:15,863
A little bit better

89
00:06:15,973 --> 00:06:18,061
For sum over the basis vectors

90
00:06:18,207 --> 00:06:22,914
which means a sum over this collection of eigenvalues a b¡­

91
00:06:23,062 --> 00:06:33,049
of the inner product of the basis vectors with the state vector

92
00:06:33,158 --> 00:06:39,048
times the basis vectors

93
00:06:39,122 --> 00:06:42,437
I've rewritten this equation is kind of equation down before

94
00:06:42,505 --> 00:06:45,202
What it says is that the expansion coefficients

95
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:48,652
that you use to expand a vector in basis vectors are

96
00:06:48,724 --> 00:06:53,283
just the inner products of the vector with the basis vectors

97
00:06:53,353 --> 00:06:58,625
this subject is called the wave function right here

98
00:06:58,733 --> 00:07:05,430
and it's a function of the a's b's and c's

99
00:07:05,501 --> 00:07:06,276
So let's give it a name

100
00:07:06,381 --> 00:07:12,984
Let's call a little psi of abc and so forth

101
00:07:13,126 --> 00:07:16,622
It's called the wave function

102
00:07:16,765 --> 00:07:21,669
and defined in such a way that the state vector psi

103
00:07:21,818 --> 00:07:26,879
is equal to the sum of a of all the indices

104
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:30,444
which takes the specified the basis

105
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:34,621
times psi of a b and c and so forth

106
00:07:34,729 --> 00:07:50,489
Psi of a b and c of coordinates  of the coordinates

107
00:07:54,593 --> 00:08:00,536
An example if we just talking about a single spin

108
00:08:00,685 --> 00:08:04,264
Then  in a complete set of commuting variables necessary

109
00:08:04,343 --> 00:08:06,791
to specify a vector

110
00:08:06,898 --> 00:08:10,749
is for example just Sigma Z  Z component of a spin

111
00:08:10,894 --> 00:08:14,883
and the psi would just be the probability amplitudes

112
00:08:15,025 --> 00:08:17,466
for the spin to be up or the spin to be down

113
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:21,904
the function of one variable that variable take on the values up and down

114
00:08:22,007 --> 00:08:28,565
if we had two spins then we would label a basis of vectors with ups

115
00:08:28,672 --> 00:08:32,444
for once up and down for one spin ups and downs for the other spin

116
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:36,417
and we'll take two labels to label a state vector  not just one

117
00:08:36,525 --> 00:08:39,193
The two labels would be the labels of the two spins

118
00:08:39,301 --> 00:08:41,879
and that's all I we were talking about here

119
00:08:41,985 --> 00:08:47,418
might take multiple labels to label a spin at the labels basis vector

120
00:08:47,525 --> 00:08:51,808
and if so just display them here and then by definition

121
00:08:51,953 --> 00:08:54,630
this pure definition the wave function of the system

122
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:56,044
You can think of it two ways

123
00:08:56,153 --> 00:09:00,123
You can think of it as the set of coefficients

124
00:09:00,192 --> 00:09:04,366
The set of coefficients that you use to expand an arbitrary vector

125
00:09:04,469 --> 00:09:06,461
in terms of the basis vectors

126
00:09:06,534 --> 00:09:10,572
Or you can think of them as the inner products

127
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:17,475
the inner products of the state vector with the basis vectors themselves

128
00:09:17,617 --> 00:09:19,514
That is called the wave function

129
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,025
And Schrodinger's wave function is a special case of it

130
00:09:22,134 --> 00:09:26,165
which we will not get to for the moment

131
00:09:26,272 --> 00:09:29,538
but it is a special case of it

132
00:09:29,573 --> 00:09:33,155
Question? Okay

133
00:09:33,336 --> 00:09:37,112
So if you know the wave function of the system

134
00:09:37,175 --> 00:09:40,822
you know its state vector and you can compute all sorts of things

135
00:09:40,857 --> 00:09:50,807
You can compute expectation values and all sorts of things

136
00:09:50,914 --> 00:09:52,066
Yeah?

137
00:09:52,172 --> 00:09:56,099
>>This looks like a little like Fourier transform in some basis

138
00:09:56,204 --> 00:09:58,461
>>Is Fourier transform? 

139
00:09:58,606 --> 00:10:06,898
Yeah  it is a Fourier transform for the case of position momentum  yes

140
00:10:07,043 --> 00:10:11,204
>>So that can be going back and forth

141
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:14,749
The Fourier transform is going back and forth

142
00:10:14,855 --> 00:10:18,438
between different basis sets  okay?

143
00:10:18,544 --> 00:10:21,354
Here  have chosen a particular basis set

144
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:27,469
Supposing I want to use a different basis instead of Sigma Z Sigma X

145
00:10:27,576 --> 00:10:30,800
Then I would have to transform these wave functions somehow

146
00:10:30,912 --> 00:10:33,241
they look different in the X basis and that's

147
00:10:33,385 --> 00:10:36,477
that's the analog of Fourier transform

148
00:10:36,622 --> 00:10:38,638
okay

149
00:10:38,784 --> 00:10:44,472
Now I want to introduce a concept called the density matrix

150
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:48,226
If we have just a single system

151
00:10:48,366 --> 00:10:51,835
this is the way we think about the state of the system

152
00:10:51,905 --> 00:10:55,215
Let's talk about expectation values

153
00:10:55,357 --> 00:11:02,703
Supposing we have some observable  let's call it L

154
00:11:02,775 --> 00:11:06,412
It's some observable and it has matrix elements

155
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:08,610
What does matrix elements mean

156
00:11:08,754 --> 00:11:11,627
They mean  if this is a basis vector

157
00:11:11,735 --> 00:11:14,323
I won't bother writing out multiple labels

158
00:11:14,392 --> 00:11:17,800
Let's just put one label L summarizing all labels

159
00:11:17,871 --> 00:11:24,607
and another label over here a prime

160
00:11:24,647 --> 00:11:29,040
These are called the matrix elements of the observable

161
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:31,091
The matrix elements of the observable

162
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,023
observable acts on a basis vector

163
00:11:33,099 --> 00:11:35,966
and then you project it onto one of the basis vector

164
00:11:36,038 --> 00:11:44,516
and that's called L  I suppose a prime a

165
00:11:44,585 --> 00:11:46,738
Just notation

166
00:11:46,777 --> 00:11:51,970
Okay now supposing I want to calculate the expectation value of L

167
00:11:52,042 --> 00:11:55,741
in a state whose wave function is psi

168
00:11:55,846 --> 00:11:57,514
Let's see how we do that

169
00:11:57,556 --> 00:11:58,824
We take a psi

170
00:11:58,897 --> 00:11:59,386
I am going to as I said

171
00:11:59,462 --> 00:12:03,241
I'm just going to restrict myself to a single  a single a here

172
00:12:03,396 --> 00:12:07,106
but the same thing withhold the multiple a's

173
00:12:07,245 --> 00:12:11,819
So what we do we take the state vector on the left  the ket vector 

174
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:15,218
the ket vector  maybe we should write up a vector here

175
00:12:15,289 --> 00:12:17,991
Sorry  the bra vector  bra vector  this is the ket vector

176
00:12:18,101 --> 00:12:22,634
The bra vector is the sum over a and b

177
00:12:22,819 --> 00:12:24,929
But you know I want to use different indices here

178
00:12:25,072 --> 00:12:27,144
I want to call them a prime and b prime

179
00:12:27,354 --> 00:12:30,285
They being summed over so it does matter what I call them

180
00:12:30,441 --> 00:12:32,231
I just don't want to confuse with these

181
00:12:32,338 --> 00:12:42,965
and then we are going to have our bra vectors a b c all

182
00:12:43,068 --> 00:12:50,099
times  I am putting a psi here  psi star

183
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:53,185
So exactly the same kind of expression for the bra vector

184
00:12:53,256 --> 00:12:57,523
except complex conjugate it coefficients

185
00:12:57,628 --> 00:13:06,796
Good  now let's calculate psi L psi

186
00:13:06,903 --> 00:13:08,405
That's the expectation value

187
00:13:08,513 --> 00:13:11,723
or the average value of L in the quantum state psi

188
00:13:11,795 --> 00:13:14,416
And we do it just by plugging in

189
00:13:14,522 --> 00:13:19,569
The left bra vector here is the sum of single index

190
00:13:19,712 --> 00:13:29,153
a prime  a prime  psi of a prime that constructs the bra vector

191
00:13:29,261 --> 00:13:32,517
The ket vector I will have to write another sum

192
00:13:32,591 --> 00:13:40,611
a sum over a  psi of a times a

193
00:13:40,684 --> 00:13:45,982
Summing on a turns this into the ket vector psi  capital psi

194
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:50,005
Summing over a prime turns us into the bra vector

195
00:13:50,073 --> 00:13:51,915
the corresponding bra vector

196
00:13:52,018 --> 00:13:56,860
and in between we sandwich L 

197
00:13:56,968 --> 00:14:02,376
Now  hu  somebody please correct me what I write that wrong

198
00:14:02,484 --> 00:14:05,355
Psi star

199
00:14:05,462 --> 00:14:11,499
We take the psi's and the psi stars out of the expression

200
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:16,578
They're just numbers and so the whole thing is sum of a prime and a

201
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:24,896
Psi star of a prime  psi of a times the inner product

202
00:14:25,003 --> 00:14:28,572
or the sandwich a prime L a

203
00:14:28,646 --> 00:14:35,443
That's exactly the matrix element of L between a and a prime

204
00:14:35,556 --> 00:14:42,774
So that's L which one is a prime a I think

205
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:48,256
And  this reduces every expectation value to a calculation

206
00:14:48,327 --> 00:14:55,189
in terms of wave functions a psi  with a psi or with a psi star

207
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:59,805
times a matrix element of the observable that were interested in

208
00:14:59,911 --> 00:15:05,777
So this is the basic formula for the expectation value of anything

209
00:15:05,885 --> 00:15:10,297
that we might be interested in

210
00:15:10,403 --> 00:15:13,727
Basically all of quantum mechanics is contained in there

211
00:15:13,803 --> 00:15:16,216
the expectation value of everything in the world

212
00:15:16,325 --> 00:15:21,179
That's  that's just about everything we ever may want to be interested in

213
00:15:21,249 --> 00:15:27,653
And so let's put this equation over here and keep it over here

214
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:32,646
Now supposing we have a composite system

215
00:15:32,717 --> 00:15:40,325
composed of two subsystems  let's call them Alice's and Bob's subsystems

216
00:15:40,402 --> 00:15:43,525
Alright  Alice has control of one of them

217
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:46,767
Bob has control of the other

218
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,855
and maybe even there are times when 

219
00:15:49,923 --> 00:15:54,535
when they don't have control of them

220
00:15:54,644 --> 00:15:59,636
but we just call them 2 subsystems  Alice's and Bob's

221
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:07,269
In fact let's use a now

222
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:13,540
to represent a complete set of observables for Alice's subsystem

223
00:16:13,873 --> 00:16:16,401
Everything that Alice needs to know

224
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:20,241
in order to specify a basis for her subsystem

225
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:24,625
And b are the set of variables for Bob's subsystem

226
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:26,408
When we talk about spin I think

227
00:16:26,451 --> 00:16:32,965
we called Alice's variable Tau and Bob's variable Sigma

228
00:16:33,069 --> 00:16:34,589
if I remember correctly

229
00:16:34,692 --> 00:16:37,864
but we just  these are a complete set of things

230
00:16:37,966 --> 00:16:40,048
A complete set of variables for Alice

231
00:16:40,117 --> 00:16:42,922
and this is a complete set of variables for Bob

232
00:16:43,064 --> 00:16:48,322
Alice's states for her subsystem would look like this

233
00:16:48,393 --> 00:16:49,581
Bob's would like that

234
00:16:49,991 --> 00:16:51,640
we may use a different notation

235
00:16:51,957 --> 00:16:55,519
so we don't wind up confusing to two vector spaces

236
00:16:55,629 --> 00:16:58,452
But then this is a composite vector space

237
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,718
The composite vector space is the vector space

238
00:17:00,794 --> 00:17:03,231
describing the composite system

239
00:17:03,306 --> 00:17:09,884
and that has a basis which consists of an a and b

240
00:17:09,992 --> 00:17:14,389
when a runs over all its values and B runs of all its values

241
00:17:14,531 --> 00:17:19,656
We have a complete basis of the combined system

242
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:24,725
Okay so now let's talk about wave functions of the composite system

243
00:17:24,834 --> 00:17:29,065
Again we have a state vector

244
00:17:29,138 --> 00:17:31,636
The state vector psi is a state vector

245
00:17:31,742 --> 00:17:36,767
in the composite in the tensor product space

246
00:17:36,876 --> 00:17:42,026
The space made by tensor producting a's and b's together

247
00:17:42,134 --> 00:17:45,059
It has  as its basis vectors

248
00:17:45,127 --> 00:17:48,961
a basis vector from a and a basis vector from b

249
00:17:49,033 --> 00:17:51,995
And now I want to define in the same way

250
00:17:52,098 --> 00:17:56,618
the notion of a composite wave function

251
00:17:56,724 --> 00:18:04,067
So what is it? It's just the inner product of psi with the basis vectors

252
00:18:04,171 --> 00:18:05,703
And what's the function of?

253
00:18:05,779 --> 00:18:09,583
Its now a function of two sets of variables  of two variables

254
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:12,897
psi of a and b  different b here

255
00:18:13,011 --> 00:18:16,357
This  we are okay  here it is

256
00:18:16,394 --> 00:18:22,437
It's a function of the variables of the two subsystems

257
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,411
It depends on two of them

258
00:18:24,485 --> 00:18:25,924
Okay  that's the wave function

259
00:18:25,967 --> 00:18:29,122
Now we have notion of a wave function of a composite system

260
00:18:29,229 --> 00:18:34,586
And let's talk about observables of a composite system

261
00:18:34,693 --> 00:18:39,974
The observables of a composite system

262
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:43,560
first of all among those variables are the ones

263
00:18:43,663 --> 00:18:48,516
which would describe the separate subsystems by themselves

264
00:18:48,622 --> 00:18:55,465
So let's suppose that L and M are two observables

265
00:18:55,511 --> 00:19:01,417
One of them having to do with Alice's subsystem  Alice

266
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,474
and the other one having to do with Bob subsystem

267
00:19:04,584 --> 00:19:07,147
I could call them L sub a and L sub b

268
00:19:07,252 --> 00:19:09,530
But I want to go call them L and M

269
00:19:09,671 --> 00:19:18,395
How do we represent observables acting on the composite space of states

270
00:19:18,502 --> 00:19:20,420
The answer is simple

271
00:19:20,524 --> 00:19:24,367
The operators associated with Alice's subsystem

272
00:19:24,511 --> 00:19:29,684
act on Alice's piece of the state vector

273
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:33,705
and leave Bob's piece of the state vector unchanged

274
00:19:33,812 --> 00:19:36,428
That's all we did when we did spins

275
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:42,440
we said Bob's Sigma matrices acted on his half of the wave function

276
00:19:42,589 --> 00:19:44,540
or his half of the basis vectors

277
00:19:44,644 --> 00:19:49,636
and were completely passive or Alice's pieces of the state vector

278
00:19:49,743 --> 00:19:53,903
was completely passive just bypassed by these operators

279
00:19:53,975 --> 00:20:04,501
So what that says  what that says is that Alice's observables are matrices

280
00:20:04,867 --> 00:20:16,849
The matrices that can be written as L of a prime b prime  just like L here

281
00:20:16,918 --> 00:20:19,452
has a prime variable and unprimed variable

282
00:20:19,557 --> 00:20:25,106
But now the single index is replaced by two indices and a and b

283
00:20:25,178 --> 00:20:26,430
What does this correspond to?

284
00:20:26,534 --> 00:20:36,924
This corresponds to the sandwich a prime b prime L a b

285
00:20:37,031 --> 00:20:39,199
Whatever a  whatever a stands for

286
00:20:39,307 --> 00:20:44,552
But L only belongs to Alice's space of states

287
00:20:44,627 --> 00:20:46,522
only belongs to Alice's system

288
00:20:46,594 --> 00:20:51,913
So the question is what then do we say about this matrix here to say

289
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:58,838
to indicate that it has no effect on Bob's variables

290
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,128
Answer is simple

291
00:21:01,192 --> 00:21:12,873
We make it proportional to the identity matrix in Bob's variables

292
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:19,342
The identity operator  identity operator in a space is the operator

293
00:21:19,452 --> 00:21:22,794
whose matrix elements are the Kronecker Delta symbol

294
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:24,754
That's the identity operator

295
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:30,065
And the identity operator on a subsystem does nothing to that subsystem

296
00:21:30,099 --> 00:21:34,094
The identity operator simply gives the same vector back

297
00:21:34,164 --> 00:21:37,726
In other words if you apply the identity operator it does nothing

298
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:40,541
But now what we are doing is applying the identity operator

299
00:21:40,612 --> 00:21:42,911
on Bob's half of the system

300
00:21:43,021 --> 00:21:46,807
but the observable that supposed to be associated

301
00:21:46,912 --> 00:21:49,047
with Alice's half of the subsystem

302
00:21:49,153 --> 00:21:54,340
is represented by the same matrix that she would've used

303
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:58,113
as she have not even known about Bob

304
00:21:58,185 --> 00:22:00,097
As she have not even known about Bob

305
00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:07,479
she would've used the matrix a L a prime and a to describe her observable

306
00:22:07,547 --> 00:22:10,287
how does she describe it in the bigger Hilbert space? 

307
00:22:10,357 --> 00:22:12,957
She says it does nothing to Bob's variables

308
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:17,477
and so it's just the identity matrix and Bob's half of the space

309
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:21,609
That's Alice's variables

310
00:22:21,716 --> 00:22:24,261
We can say the same thing about Bob's

311
00:22:24,332 --> 00:22:30,574
M of a prime and b prime and a and b

312
00:22:30,687 --> 00:22:35,460
just equal to the Kronecker  Delta of Alice's variables

313
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:40,812
times the matrix that Bob would've used

314
00:22:40,885 --> 00:22:46,744
to describe the subsystem having not known anything about Alice

315
00:22:46,857 --> 00:22:55,827
Okay  let's prove some things about the about the setup here

316
00:22:55,901 --> 00:22:57,525
First of all  let's calculate

317
00:22:57,631 --> 00:23:03,418
expectation values of Alice's variables in a product state

318
00:23:03,557 --> 00:23:04,957
A product state is one

319
00:23:05,032 --> 00:23:08,817
in which the two systems are not entangled with each other

320
00:23:08,962 --> 00:23:15,426
unless you  what we get

321
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:20,084
What would you expect to get if you have in un-entangled state

322
00:23:20,194 --> 00:23:23,402
describing Alice's and Bob's subsystems

323
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:31,948
and you consider the expectation value of Alice's variable

324
00:23:32,017 --> 00:23:36,806
We get exactly what you've gotten  had Bob not been there all together

325
00:23:36,912 --> 00:23:38,274
So let's check that out

326
00:23:38,347 --> 00:23:42,177
What do I mean first of all by a product state?

327
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:44,000
I explained the product state was

328
00:23:44,112 --> 00:23:45,872
But now let me explain what a product state is

329
00:23:45,978 --> 00:23:49,636
in the language of wave functions  is very simple

330
00:23:49,741 --> 00:23:53,829
It  means that the wave function is a product of two wave functions

331
00:23:53,931 --> 00:23:56,210
one from Alice and one from Bob

332
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,927
That's all it means

333
00:23:58,002 --> 00:24:04,100
A product state is one whose wave function psi of a and b

334
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:07,750
Alice's and Bob's variables  is just a product

335
00:24:07,893 --> 00:24:10,224
So let's see how shall we denote that

336
00:24:10,298 --> 00:24:23,756
Let's call it  well let's just call it psi Alice of A and phi Bob of B

337
00:24:23,803 --> 00:24:25,252
It factorizes

338
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:28,253
It's a product of two functions 

339
00:24:28,357 --> 00:24:30,230
It's a function of two variables

340
00:24:30,337 --> 00:24:34,460
but it's a product of two functions each of one variable

341
00:24:34,568 --> 00:24:38,580
it's pretty clear that if you factorizes like this

342
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:42,341
then Alice can think of this as the wave function for her subsystem

343
00:24:42,413 --> 00:24:46,817
and Bob thinks of this as the wave function for his subsystem

344
00:24:47,208 --> 00:24:52,825
Okay  let's calculate now Alice's expectation value of L

345
00:24:52,898 --> 00:24:55,060
if this happens to be the wave function

346
00:24:55,129 --> 00:24:56,950
So what do we do? We first takes psi

347
00:24:57,025 --> 00:24:58,441
We are going to make a sandwich

348
00:24:58,549 --> 00:24:59,257
We are making a sandwich

349
00:24:59,332 --> 00:25:02,014
with the psi star on one side the psi on the other side

350
00:25:02,851 --> 00:25:05,014
and L in between

351
00:25:05,124 --> 00:25:13,824
So that's psi star  that's psi star of Alice of a prime

352
00:25:13,933 --> 00:25:18,159
Phi star Bob of b prime

353
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:25,747
This is  where we write it? Here

354
00:25:25,854 --> 00:25:28,406
That's the complex conjugate of the wave function

355
00:25:28,513 --> 00:25:31,113
As a function of a prime b prime

356
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,882
What next?

357
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:42,807
Next we put in to the sandwich L of a prime b prime a and b

358
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:43,976
It's a matrix

359
00:25:44,085 --> 00:25:46,089
One entry here  one entry here

360
00:25:46,193 --> 00:25:47,364
But it's simple

361
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:55,920
It's just L of a prime and a times Delta b b prime

362
00:25:56,028 --> 00:25:58,268
and then we close it up with the other half of the sandwich

363
00:25:58,419 --> 00:26:05,876
which is this up here  psi A of a  phi B of b

364
00:26:05,983 --> 00:26:10,076
Now we sum  as always we sum over everything in sight

365
00:26:10,183 --> 00:26:14,774
a prime  a  b prime  b

366
00:26:14,843 --> 00:26:17,428
That's the rule for calculating an expectation value

367
00:26:17,499 --> 00:26:19,357
So what do we get?

368
00:26:19,464 --> 00:26:26,730
First of all the Delta b b prime  that tells us to set b prime equal to b

369
00:26:26,805 --> 00:26:27,720
So let's do that

370
00:26:27,823 --> 00:26:30,158
First of all  let's do that

371
00:26:30,229 --> 00:26:32,697
I'll just erase

372
00:26:32,765 --> 00:26:34,661
So b prime equal to b

373
00:26:34,731 --> 00:26:37,964
Alright  I'll let you write down your notes if you want

374
00:26:38,108 --> 00:26:42,168
So b prime equal to b and remove the Kronecker Delta

375
00:26:42,274 --> 00:26:44,080
Now b is equal to b prime

376
00:26:44,184 --> 00:26:50,538
Then notice the only thing it depends on B is phi star B and phi B

377
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:55,314
What the sum over b prime was done when I said b equal to b prime

378
00:26:55,418 --> 00:26:58,814
Then we sum over be of phi star phi

379
00:26:58,885 --> 00:27:00,563
What does that give?

380
00:27:00,669 --> 00:27:02,032
One

381
00:27:02,104 --> 00:27:06,879
Under the assumption of course that Bob's wave functions is normalized

382
00:27:06,983 --> 00:27:11,072
Under the assumption that Bob's half of the way functions is normalized

383
00:27:11,181 --> 00:27:15,356
So that his total probability for his all his measurements

384
00:27:15,459 --> 00:27:16,742
he could do is one

385
00:27:16,849 --> 00:27:22,215
Then sum over b of phi star of B times phi of B is just one

386
00:27:22,316 --> 00:27:24,293
And what does the whole thing reduce to?

387
00:27:24,369 --> 00:27:28,393
The whole thing reduces to exactly what's up there

388
00:27:28,434 --> 00:27:31,756
We can remove the phi's

389
00:27:31,826 --> 00:27:38,290
Take them out  bring down here

390
00:27:38,397 --> 00:27:42,346
That sum was just one  and the rest of it is just exactly

391
00:27:42,454 --> 00:27:45,597
what's up on the top of the blackboard there

392
00:27:45,744 --> 00:27:48,840
Another words in a product state the expectation value

393
00:27:48,984 --> 00:27:53,407
of any of Alice's operators are exactly the same

394
00:27:53,516 --> 00:27:58,101
as if Bob wasn't there

395
00:27:58,202 --> 00:28:00,239
And it doesn't matter what Bob's wave function is

396
00:28:00,347 --> 00:28:03,858
as long as it's a product

397
00:28:03,964 --> 00:28:09,228
What about the one of Bob's expectation values

398
00:28:09,298 --> 00:28:12,494
Or what happens if we stuck a  Bob operator in there?

399
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:16,696
Well  then instead of the Kronecker Delta of b-s

400
00:28:16,836 --> 00:28:20,809
let's go back b and b prime

401
00:28:20,917 --> 00:28:27,363
the b and b prime  b and b prime  b prime over here

402
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:32,941
And instead of L  in a prime  L we would have M of b and b prime

403
00:28:33,022 --> 00:28:35,310
Delta a  a prime

404
00:28:35,384 --> 00:28:40,227
and now we would set a prime equal to a

405
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:43,341
Sum  that would again give us one

406
00:28:43,383 --> 00:28:44,340
and we will get the same

407
00:28:44,414 --> 00:28:51,848
We'll get basically the same thing that I wrote up here

408
00:28:51,919 --> 00:29:01,667
Bob  except it would be Bob's wave function phi star 

409
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:13,403
Bob of b prime  M of b prime  b  times phi Bob of b

410
00:29:13,473 --> 00:29:16,806
which is exactly what Bob would've done

411
00:29:16,877 --> 00:29:18,599
had not known about Alice

412
00:29:18,745 --> 00:29:24,353
So product states are really just that the states

413
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:28,861
in which one party just doesn't know about the other

414
00:29:28,932 --> 00:29:38,272
is no correlation  is no information in one of them about the other

415
00:29:38,374 --> 00:29:43,461
Ok. We can say a little bit more about correlation

416
00:29:43,565 --> 00:29:48,291
Let's suppose now what that we are interested in

417
00:29:48,364 --> 00:29:52,897
the product of an Alice variable and a Bob variable

418
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:57,122
we are interested in the expectation value of L times M

419
00:29:57,192 --> 00:29:59,088
Let's see what we get

420
00:29:59,163 --> 00:30:03,609
Expectation in a product state  strictly product state for the moment

421
00:30:03,651 --> 00:30:06,751
We go back up to here

422
00:30:06,822 --> 00:30:12,177
and now instead of writing M b   this should be b  b prime

423
00:30:12,286 --> 00:30:14,656
This should be b prime

424
00:30:14,725 --> 00:30:20,381
Instead of Delta of a and a prime  if we would take the product of L and M

425
00:30:20,449 --> 00:30:26,302
Then what I put here?

426
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:29,199
L

427
00:30:29,268 --> 00:30:30,909
If I'm interested in the operator

428
00:30:31,015 --> 00:30:35,427
which represents the product of two variables

429
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:37,331
One for Alice and one for Bob

430
00:30:37,392 --> 00:30:40,872
instead of putting the unit operator up here for Alice

431
00:30:40,943 --> 00:30:55,403
I will simply put in Alice's operator  not M  L

432
00:30:55,477 --> 00:30:57,095
Now this just factorizes

433
00:30:57,236 --> 00:30:58,719
Let's look at all the a dependence

434
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:03,863
Here's a dependence

435
00:31:03,932 --> 00:31:07,565
That factorizes let's completely separate from the b dependence

436
00:31:07,673 --> 00:31:09,867
I could take everything with a b dependence

437
00:31:09,938 --> 00:31:11,564
and put on one side

438
00:31:11,707 --> 00:31:14,087
Everything with an a dependence put on the other side

439
00:31:14,196 --> 00:31:20,281
and do the a and b summations independently

440
00:31:20,316 --> 00:31:27,422
Can you see that? That  let's write that out

441
00:31:27,532 --> 00:31:39,386
Sum of a prime  a  b prime  b  of psi Alice star of a prime L a a prime

442
00:31:39,453 --> 00:31:42,308
psi Alice of a

443
00:31:42,382 --> 00:31:59,349
all times phi Bob star of b prime  M of  b  b prime and phi of b

444
00:31:59,451 --> 00:32:05,114
The sums can be done quite independently

445
00:32:05,221 --> 00:32:06,655
We can put the sum over here

446
00:32:06,761 --> 00:32:09,932
Same thing  I haven't changed it  with summing over everything

447
00:32:10,006 --> 00:32:12,013
b's and a's

448
00:32:12,083 --> 00:32:14,378
And we see all we get is just a product

449
00:32:14,485 --> 00:32:17,726
We get the product of the expectation value of L

450
00:32:17,903 --> 00:32:21,505
times the expectation value of M

451
00:32:21,573 --> 00:32:24,546
Not surprising if we have a product state

452
00:32:24,654 --> 00:32:28,554
and Alice does her measurement and Bob does his measurement

453
00:32:28,623 --> 00:32:30,917
and we then come together and compare the measurements

454
00:32:30,986 --> 00:32:34,092
and ask what was a product of the measurements

455
00:32:34,162 --> 00:32:37,543
The expectation value will just be the product

456
00:32:37,614 --> 00:32:40,316
The expectation value of the product operator

457
00:32:40,423 --> 00:32:42,796
will be the product of expectation values

458
00:32:42,895 --> 00:32:44,363
We can write this this way

459
00:32:44,475 --> 00:32:56,923
Let's write it in a form for product states

460
00:32:56,992 --> 00:33:02,947
for product  let's call product states

461
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:07,291
The expectation value of L and times M

462
00:33:07,437 --> 00:33:11,928
Now remember L belongs to Alice  M belongs to Bob

463
00:33:11,996 --> 00:33:17,012
and they operate in different halves of the system

464
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,492
The expectation value of L times M

465
00:33:19,636 --> 00:33:27,110
is just the expectation value of L times the expectation value of M

466
00:33:27,219 --> 00:33:33,913
Now  is this something that we expect always be true for every state?

467
00:33:33,953 --> 00:33:39,594
That the expectation value in fact even in classical probability theory

468
00:33:39,731 --> 00:33:43,292
if we have a probability distribution for two variables

469
00:33:43,361 --> 00:33:47,527
in general is it true that the average of the product

470
00:33:47,596 --> 00:33:49,472
is the product of the average?

471
00:33:49,541 --> 00:33:50,941
>>The variables are already there

472
00:33:51,045 --> 00:33:54,886
Which means what becomes of the probability distribution

473
00:33:54,993 --> 00:33:56,167
>>Exactly what you've written there

474
00:33:56,237 --> 00:33:58,320
It means that factorizes

475
00:33:58,391 --> 00:33:59,913
It means the probability distribution

476
00:33:59,984 --> 00:34:02,790
is the product of 2 probability distributions

477
00:34:02,861 --> 00:34:06,666
Alright  well  what if it's not true?

478
00:34:06,739 --> 00:34:09,979
What if the probability distribution does not factorize

479
00:34:10,054 --> 00:34:12,874
Then this quantity here

480
00:34:12,945 --> 00:34:16,997
The difference between the average of L times M

481
00:34:17,072 --> 00:34:19,226
And the product of averages of L and M

482
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:22,637
is called the correlation between L and M

483
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:28,221
is called the correlation

484
00:34:28,296 --> 00:34:31,627
and is a measure of how much these variables are correlated

485
00:34:31,698 --> 00:34:34,080
We will see some examples

486
00:34:34,152 --> 00:34:38,495
This is called correlation and whenever the correlation

487
00:34:38,567 --> 00:34:42,595
whenever there is anything in the system

488
00:34:42,642 --> 00:34:45,326
and Alice variable and a Bob variable

489
00:34:45,397 --> 00:34:49,314
whose correlation is not zero

490
00:34:49,386 --> 00:34:53,849
That's an indication of entanglement

491
00:34:53,887 --> 00:34:56,173
If you can find any pair of variables

492
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:58,910
one of Alice's and one of Bob's

493
00:34:58,986 --> 00:35:03,842
such that the average of the product is not the product of the averages

494
00:35:03,914 --> 00:35:17,511
Then you're experiencing entanglement

495
00:35:17,619 --> 00:35:23,347
I think we did an example last time

496
00:35:23,416 --> 00:35:25,859
We took what I call the singlet state

497
00:35:25,937 --> 00:35:38,391
which was up down minus down up over the square root of two

498
00:35:38,499 --> 00:35:41,148
This is psi and this is not a product state

499
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:49,833
and in the state we took the expectation value of Bob's variable  Sigma Z

500
00:35:49,904 --> 00:35:53,971
We took the expectation value of Alice's variable

501
00:35:54,076 --> 00:35:56,373
which I think was Tau Z

502
00:35:56,479 --> 00:35:57,874
You remember what these were?

503
00:35:57,944 --> 00:36:03,314
What's the average value of Bob's variable?

504
00:36:03,354 --> 00:36:07,866
Let's say the first entry here  the first entry stands for Bob

505
00:36:07,973 --> 00:36:14,317
is Bob  Bob  this is Alice

506
00:36:14,388 --> 00:36:20,517
Well what would you guess in the state the average of Sigma Z is?

507
00:36:20,587 --> 00:36:24,375
Not the state  but the combined state

508
00:36:24,479 --> 00:36:24,544
>>Zero

509
00:36:24,585 --> 00:36:25,482
No.

510
00:36:25,531 --> 00:36:27,878
Zero? Why is zero?

511
00:36:27,953 --> 00:36:32,735
Because it has as much probability of being up as being down

512
00:36:32,807 --> 00:36:34,078
Has probability one over

513
00:36:34,146 --> 00:36:38,144
has probability one half to be up and one have to be down

514
00:36:38,213 --> 00:36:41,490
So the average of Bob's variable is zero

515
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,640
I think we work that out last time

516
00:36:44,713 --> 00:36:47,528
What about Alice's variable?

517
00:36:47,636 --> 00:36:52,683
It's also up as much as it's down

518
00:36:52,755 --> 00:36:55,367
It's also expectation values zero

519
00:36:55,437 --> 00:36:57,309
What about?

520
00:36:57,385 --> 00:37:03,231
So first step  both of these are zero in this case

521
00:37:03,338 --> 00:37:05,269
What about the product?

522
00:37:05,377 --> 00:37:09,367
What about the product of Sigma Z and Tau Z?

523
00:37:09,469 --> 00:37:12,437
What its average value?

524
00:37:12,508 --> 00:37:15,396
Well  we worked that out last time

525
00:37:15,475 --> 00:37:16,664
We've gotten the answer

526
00:37:16,773 --> 00:37:17,617
Anybody remember the answer?

527
00:37:17,688 --> 00:37:18,258
>>Minus one

528
00:37:18,367 --> 00:37:19,467
Minus one

529
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,229
But you can just look at this thing

530
00:37:21,298 --> 00:37:25,705
and you can say in both vectors here  the spins are opposite

531
00:37:25,775 --> 00:37:29,487
So in either case here  the product of the spins is minus one

532
00:37:29,587 --> 00:37:34,513
It's pretty clear that this whole thing is an eigenvector of the product

533
00:37:34,621 --> 00:37:39,227
because on either vector here  the product is minus one

534
00:37:39,337 --> 00:37:45,986
Act with Sigma Z  you get  you know what would happen

535
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:49,466
So you'll just change sign

536
00:37:49,538 --> 00:37:54,837
So yes this has the product of Sigma Z is equal to one

537
00:37:54,947 --> 00:37:57,650
Minus one  excuse me

538
00:37:57,723 --> 00:38:00,703
So they are entangled

539
00:38:00,775 --> 00:38:04,212
In fact  in this case where we call maximally entangled

540
00:38:04,281 --> 00:38:05,898
They are very entangled

541
00:38:05,965 --> 00:38:09,818
If you can find any pair of variables

542
00:38:09,889 --> 00:38:12,497
which are correlated in this form

543
00:38:12,568 --> 00:38:14,538
the quantum state is entangled

544
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:18,696
Do you remember now here it's completely obvious

545
00:38:18,805 --> 00:38:20,952
that the average of Sigma Z is zero

546
00:38:21,058 --> 00:38:22,705
for just the reasons I said

547
00:38:22,776 --> 00:38:25,658
For Sigma Z and Tau Z

548
00:38:25,734 --> 00:38:27,906
Up appears as much is down for Bob

549
00:38:28,017 --> 00:38:30,896
and down appears as much is up for Alice

550
00:38:31,005 --> 00:38:33,058
and so it's clear the average is zero

551
00:38:33,168 --> 00:38:42,031
What about the average of Sigma X? Do you remember?

552
00:38:42,139 --> 00:38:46,199
Zero  but that's not obvious  is it?

553
00:38:46,303 --> 00:38:48,931
That's not obvious

554
00:38:49,033 --> 00:38:52,392
But we did it last time  go back to your notes

555
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:59,086
And you'll discover not only is the expectation value of Sigma Z zero

556
00:38:59,156 --> 00:39:02,728
but Sigma X is also equal to zero  the average

557
00:39:02,832 --> 00:39:04,684
On the other hand you also find

558
00:39:04,796 --> 00:39:09,775
that the product of Bob Sigma X and Alice's Tau X

559
00:39:09,843 --> 00:39:13,223
is again equal to minus one

560
00:39:13,294 --> 00:39:18,006
So the Sigma Z's and the Tau Z's are correlated

561
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,499
Sigma X's and the Tau X's correlated

562
00:39:20,607 --> 00:39:23,511
and what about Y? same thing

563
00:39:23,615 --> 00:39:25,053
Same exact thing

564
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:26,020
You work that out

565
00:39:26,127 --> 00:39:27,809
We know what these operators do

566
00:39:27,883 --> 00:39:29,364
You can apply them to the states

567
00:39:29,438 --> 00:39:32,173
and calculate what the expectation value is

568
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:36,841
So the state is a highly  a highly entangled  a highly correlated state

569
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:39,751
being correlated and being entangled are basically the same idea

570
00:39:39,861 --> 00:39:41,567
>>Question?

571
00:39:41,634 --> 00:39:42,393
Yeah?

572
00:39:42,465 --> 00:39:46,361
>>In the general case  if you put the L in the end of M

573
00:39:46,468 --> 00:39:48,592
>>say equal to each other

574
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:54,519
>> put the L in the M's  LM

575
00:39:54,625 --> 00:40:03,055
>> minus bracket L bracket M equals ML minus the second  (mumble) 

576
00:40:03,128 --> 00:40:03,774
No

577
00:40:03,881 --> 00:40:05,167
>> It just put the L in the end

578
00:40:05,274 --> 00:40:06,057
Oh  yeah

579
00:40:06,129 --> 00:40:07,279
>>That's equal  right?

580
00:40:07,351 --> 00:40:08,392
You can show

581
00:40:08,499 --> 00:40:09,966
>>Ok. So

582
00:40:10,071 --> 00:40:11,500
Alright 

583
00:40:11,605 --> 00:40:14,738
It's a point there which I may not mention

584
00:40:14,811 --> 00:40:17,828
All operators are associated with one system

585
00:40:17,977 --> 00:40:21,921
commute with all operators associated with the other system

586
00:40:22,028 --> 00:40:25,415
So it doesn't matter in which order you write them

587
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:27,897
That's independent of whether the system is entangled

588
00:40:28,004 --> 00:40:30,399
It doesn't the matter which order you write them

589
00:40:30,468 --> 00:40:31,248
>>Excuse me

590
00:40:31,318 --> 00:40:32,090
Yeah?

591
00:40:32,203 --> 00:40:35,194
>>I guess I am missing something

592
00:40:35,262 --> 00:40:36,368
>>When you wrote that down

593
00:40:36,472 --> 00:40:39,448
>>you show how the state if you have a product state that

594
00:40:39,554 --> 00:40:42,100
>>when L is a state in Alice's M

595
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:43,549
Yeah  then this is equal to zero

596
00:40:43,654 --> 00:40:45,431
>>And that's equal to zero

597
00:40:45,502 --> 00:40:49,732
>>What does L M mean? Is that a product state?

598
00:40:49,805 --> 00:40:51,563
This? No

599
00:40:51,671 --> 00:40:52,504
>>What is it? In general

600
00:40:52,614 --> 00:40:53,441
The state is  these are the states

601
00:40:53,548 --> 00:40:55,427
These are the observables

602
00:40:55,497 --> 00:40:56,165
>>Right?

603
00:40:56,273 --> 00:40:57,063
Right

604
00:40:57,169 --> 00:40:59,042
>>Isn't that LM a product state?

605
00:40:59,112 --> 00:41:02,836
No. L's and M's are not states

606
00:41:02,946 --> 00:41:05,585
>>Observables

607
00:41:05,693 --> 00:41:09,247
Yeah  there are psi's in here

608
00:41:09,317 --> 00:41:10,114
>>Ok

609
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:19,626
This is the statement about the state vectors

610
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:23,522
Right

611
00:41:23,633 --> 00:41:27,771
Ok  one other point is what just noticing

612
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:31,065
When I say things are correlated  the spins are correlated

613
00:41:31,167 --> 00:41:34,207
I mean it  what I mean is that you can learn something

614
00:41:34,275 --> 00:41:37,873
about one variable by looking at the other

615
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:41,331
If you know this is a state  if you happen to know that this is the state

616
00:41:41,402 --> 00:41:47,077
then if you know Bob's  if you measure Bob's variable

617
00:41:47,147 --> 00:41:51,977
and you find out that it's up then in that component of the state

618
00:41:52,081 --> 00:41:54,845
which is the only one left at the measure Bob

619
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:57,149
Alice is down

620
00:41:57,217 --> 00:42:00,290
In a product state  you learn nothing about one system

621
00:42:00,432 --> 00:42:02,387
by measuring anything about the other

622
00:42:02,496 --> 00:42:06,161
In a highly entangled state you learn a great deal about one system

623
00:42:06,269 --> 00:42:09,421
by measuring the other one

624
00:42:09,529 --> 00:42:12,352
That's what entanglement means

625
00:42:12,461 --> 00:42:15,508
In the other hand  it may also follow  it may also be true

626
00:42:15,614 --> 00:42:18,640
that in a highly entangled state before hand

627
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:20,392
if you happen to know the state

628
00:42:20,502 --> 00:42:26,711
you may know very little about each individual piece

629
00:42:26,783 --> 00:42:30,559
For example in the singlet state here

630
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:36,342
there is  what is it the probability that Bob's variable is up

631
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:37,510
One half 

632
00:42:37,583 --> 00:42:40,938
What is the probability Bob's variable is down

633
00:42:41,048 --> 00:42:42,621
One half

634
00:42:42,731 --> 00:42:48,923
So when the state knowing  knowing everything about the state

635
00:42:49,031 --> 00:42:52,586
you still know nothing about whether Bob measures up or down

636
00:42:52,694 --> 00:42:55,060
if he does the measurement

637
00:42:55,132 --> 00:42:57,263
Curious  you know nothing at all

638
00:42:57,370 --> 00:42:59,569
about whether Bob measures up or down

639
00:42:59,713 --> 00:43:01,016
You know nothing at all about

640
00:43:01,084 --> 00:43:02,941
what Alice measures up or down

641
00:43:03,012 --> 00:43:07,106
But you know everything about the product of them

642
00:43:07,213 --> 00:43:10,907
that if Bob does his measurement  Alice does her measurement

643
00:43:11,014 --> 00:43:14,725
and you compare them afterwards every single time

644
00:43:14,829 --> 00:43:17,609
If this is the state that you put the system into

645
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:20,657
the product will be minus

646
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:24,642
So this is an example of this odd thing quantum mechanics

647
00:43:24,716 --> 00:43:28,532
You can know everything about a composite system

648
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:32,293
and know nothing about the pieces

649
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,492
That's what this is telling you

650
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:36,991
You know everything  when I say you know everything

651
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:41,389
I mean you know as much as quantum mechanics allows you to know

652
00:43:41,499 --> 00:43:42,389
This is the state of the system

653
00:43:42,497 --> 00:43:44,485
you are not gonna do any better than that

654
00:43:44,556 --> 00:43:48,329
That's all there is to know about it

655
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:51,970
What you know about it is that Sigma times Tau

656
00:43:52,047 --> 00:43:54,144
whether will it be Sigma X or Tau X

657
00:43:54,394 --> 00:43:57,336
It is true for the XY or Z component separately

658
00:43:57,446 --> 00:44:02,853
that the product of Alice's variable and Bob's variable is minus one

659
00:44:02,954 --> 00:44:04,280
That's a lot to know

660
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:06,661
But it's not as much as you would know classically

661
00:44:06,768 --> 00:44:09,006
Classically  if you know everything about a system

662
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:11,706
you would know everything about the constituents

663
00:44:11,809 --> 00:44:15,101
as well as things that you could measure about that

664
00:44:15,208 --> 00:44:17,202
you could combine together

665
00:44:17,311 --> 00:44:18,649
In quantum mechanics you can't know

666
00:44:18,755 --> 00:44:21,540
Either you can say you can't know everything

667
00:44:21,648 --> 00:44:26,172
or to the extent that everything is everything you can know

668
00:44:26,316 --> 00:44:29,750
In this case  you know everything about the combined system

669
00:44:29,858 --> 00:44:32,029
and you know nothing about its constituents

670
00:44:32,175 --> 00:44:36,783
That's the really odd thing about entanglement

671
00:44:36,923 --> 00:44:42,884
That's extremely odd property of quantum mechanics

672
00:44:43,024 --> 00:44:54,089
That allows such nonsense

673
00:44:54,308 --> 00:45:02,063
>>With that speech you can't separate the components of the system

674
00:45:02,173 --> 00:45:04,738
>>without information gotten from each other?

675
00:45:04,843 --> 00:45:09,185
Yeah  yeah  it does mean that

676
00:45:09,327 --> 00:45:15,104
>>When you write LM  I am gotten confused

677
00:45:15,245 --> 00:45:21,952
>>Is that measure M and then measure L?

678
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:23,004
No  no  no

679
00:45:23,111 --> 00:45:24,895
>>It's the product L and M?

680
00:45:24,968 --> 00:45:27,040
Ok  let's be very clear

681
00:45:27,147 --> 00:45:28,076
Let's be very clear

682
00:45:28,189 --> 00:45:33,413
The operation  the operation mathematical operation

683
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,299
of multiplying a state vector by an operator

684
00:45:36,408 --> 00:45:41,088
is not that anything to do with the actual physical act of measuring it

685
00:45:41,233 --> 00:45:43,022
>>I know  but the syntax looks the same

686
00:45:43,166 --> 00:45:50,544
The syntax is not the same

687
00:45:50,689 --> 00:45:52,606
The syntax  I'm not sure what syntax means

688
00:45:52,713 --> 00:45:54,262
I assume it means the words

689
00:45:54,402 --> 00:45:58,785
>>It just means how interprete M and L on the board  that's all

690
00:45:58,929 --> 00:46:03,746
>>The product of the operators

691
00:46:03,855 --> 00:46:06,155
Yes  yes  it means you act first with M and then L

692
00:46:06,262 --> 00:46:07,132
>>Ok

693
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,489
>>That's enough

694
00:46:08,593 --> 00:46:11,258
Yeah  but it doesn't mean you've measured them

695
00:46:11,403 --> 00:46:17,897
That means is just a mathematical thing  right?

696
00:46:18,039 --> 00:46:21,616
The same is true in the classical mechanics

697
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:26,339
I can multiply the momentum of something by the position of something else

698
00:46:26,449 --> 00:46:27,616
That doesn't mean I measure them

699
00:46:27,724 --> 00:46:31,808
just because of I multiply the two things together

700
00:46:31,916 --> 00:46:33,659
Physical act of measurement

701
00:46:33,765 --> 00:46:37,793
It's not the operators which act on the states

702
00:46:37,899 --> 00:46:43,069
It's the detectors or apparatuses which act on the system

703
00:46:43,184 --> 00:46:46,382
So in words when you do a measurement

704
00:46:46,486 --> 00:46:53,232
a detector or an apparatus acts on the system and gives result

705
00:46:53,340 --> 00:47:02,277
In the space of states  a operator acts on a vector

706
00:47:02,384 --> 00:47:05,891
not a detector acting on the system

707
00:47:05,997 --> 00:47:07,448
Quite different concepts

708
00:47:07,595 --> 00:47:09,982
Yeah?

709
00:47:10,089 --> 00:47:16,312
>>If we make a measurement on electrons

710
00:47:16,418 --> 00:47:19,209
>>unless we already know how it's been prepared

711
00:47:19,315 --> 00:47:21,427
>>which is a special case

712
00:47:21,533 --> 00:47:25,575
>>In that case we can describe the state

713
00:47:25,682 --> 00:47:27,452
>>as linear combination of basis vectors

714
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:28,135
Yeah

715
00:47:28,246 --> 00:47:31,722
>>But  before we make a measurement  we might know nothing about

716
00:47:31,828 --> 00:47:33,701
>>We might know a little bit about it

717
00:47:33,812 --> 00:47:36,781
>>No matter how much we know  we have to

718
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:38,946
>>expressed in terms of probabilities

719
00:47:39,053 --> 00:47:41,000
>>Not in terms of the vectors?

720
00:47:41,107 --> 00:47:41,891
Yes

721
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:48,049
>>And so in case there's a correlation between two electrons

722
00:47:48,158 --> 00:47:50,820
>>Let's say it's not a pure correlation

723
00:47:50,934 --> 00:47:52,716
>>It's a partial

724
00:47:52,825 --> 00:47:54,609
>>It's not a product

725
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:57,360
>>It's not an truly intrinsic state in somewhere between

726
00:47:57,468 --> 00:47:58,254
It's not a what?

727
00:47:58,361 --> 00:48:00,590
>>A singlet state  for example

728
00:48:00,666 --> 00:48:02,920
It's a somewhat entangled state

729
00:48:03,027 --> 00:48:03,944
>>Exactly

730
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:08,166
>>So  if  then after we make the Sigma measurement

731
00:48:08,268 --> 00:48:12,349
>>and we want to describe the Tau of electron

732
00:48:12,452 --> 00:48:17,144
>>we still have to describe Tau in terms of probabilities

733
00:48:17,187 --> 00:48:22,706
>>You wouldn't be able to specify in terms of a combination

734
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:26,003
Ok. I am not exactly sure what you are getting yet

735
00:48:26,149 --> 00:48:28,955
But maybe this will help

736
00:48:29,061 --> 00:48:33,664
If we have the quantum state of a single spin

737
00:48:33,737 --> 00:48:35,739
Let's suppose somebody told us

738
00:48:35,848 --> 00:48:39,843
what the state of the quantum state of the spin was

739
00:48:39,985 --> 00:48:44,923
then for any quantum state there is always an observable

740
00:48:45,031 --> 00:48:47,801
in particular some component of Sigma

741
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:51,155
which is definite  which is predictable

742
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:56,410
Every part  that's obvious for the states up and down

743
00:48:56,517 --> 00:48:58,823
It's obvious for the states left and right

744
00:48:58,968 --> 00:49:02,743
To the state up if you measure Sigma Z is definite

745
00:49:02,849 --> 00:49:06,604
If you measure  if you know that the state is right

746
00:49:06,708 --> 00:49:09,666
and you measure Sigma X  it's definite

747
00:49:09,776 --> 00:49:10,961
This is more general

748
00:49:11,068 --> 00:49:14,493
Given any quantum state whatever of the spin

749
00:49:14,598 --> 00:49:17,232
there exists a direction that you can prove

750
00:49:17,375 --> 00:49:22,386
that there exists direction for which the spin is definite  okay?

751
00:49:22,526 --> 00:49:26,431
Curiously when you combine the system together into

752
00:49:26,534 --> 00:49:28,825
an entangled state like this

753
00:49:28,933 --> 00:49:33,306
There is no direction in which the spin is definite

754
00:49:33,413 --> 00:49:37,960
In fact there is no direction Sigma X for one of the spins

755
00:49:38,067 --> 00:49:41,728
Each one of the spins either Alice's or Bob's

756
00:49:41,877 --> 00:49:46,948
has average value zero in every direction

757
00:49:47,089 --> 00:49:50,920
No matter what direction you pick  X  Y  Z or anything in between

758
00:49:51,062 --> 00:49:55,643
the average of the spin the Bob's spin in the state is zero

759
00:49:55,785 --> 00:49:59,353
so  in his quantum state in which Bob can say nothing

760
00:49:59,499 --> 00:50:01,364
what he cannot know what quantum state fully

761
00:50:01,502 --> 00:50:07,092
and as I said has equal probability for up and down in every direction

762
00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:10,808
I'm not sure if that's what you're addressing or not

763
00:50:10,918 --> 00:50:16,342
>>My question in that show if you have a partial correlation

764
00:50:16,482 --> 00:50:17,813
Partial  Ok

765
00:50:17,918 --> 00:50:20,064
>>Somewhere between zero and one

766
00:50:20,171 --> 00:50:24,141
So we put a big number here and a small number here

767
00:50:24,285 --> 00:50:25,484
>>We measured one and

768
00:50:25,623 --> 00:50:29,667
>>then the other quickly expressed as pure probability

769
00:50:29,777 --> 00:50:31,286
>>as Sigma X and Sigma Y

770
00:50:31,392 --> 00:50:37,878
Yes  we can calculate all the probabilities  calculate them  yeah

771
00:50:37,989 --> 00:50:39,446
Okay

772
00:50:39,555 --> 00:50:41,354
>>Did you remind us the physical

773
00:50:41,459 --> 00:50:42,390
What is that?

774
00:50:42,495 --> 00:50:43,573
>>the singlet state

775
00:50:43,681 --> 00:50:44,709
Say it again?

776
00:50:44,812 --> 00:50:47,956
>>What would be inventible physical experiment

777
00:50:48,066 --> 00:50:49,432
>>corresponds to singlet state?

778
00:50:49,535 --> 00:50:55,788
Good  that's an obviously important question

779
00:50:55,895 --> 00:50:59,250
Another way to ask is how would you prepare a state

780
00:50:59,351 --> 00:51:00,822
a system in the singlet state

781
00:51:00,934 --> 00:51:05,777
Alright  I'll tell you have something about the singlet state

782
00:51:05,882 --> 00:51:08,561
The singlet state has the property

783
00:51:08,668 --> 00:51:11,431
that it's an eigenvector of a certain operator

784
00:51:11,537 --> 00:51:12,997
It's eigenvector many operators

785
00:51:13,105 --> 00:51:17,683
but in particular it's an eigenvector of Sigma X Tau X

786
00:51:17,799 --> 00:51:18,587
You can prove it

787
00:51:18,695 --> 00:51:22,001
It's actually an eigenvector of Sigma X Tau X

788
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:25,929
It's an eigenvector of Sigma Y Tau Y

789
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:29,294
And it's an eigenvector of Sigma Z Tau Z

790
00:51:29,404 --> 00:51:32,227
What's the eigenvalue for each one of these?

791
00:51:32,303 --> 00:51:36,030
Minus one  and the eigenvalues are the same for all of them 

792
00:51:36,104 --> 00:51:39,655
That means that it's an eigenvector of any linear 

793
00:51:39,755 --> 00:51:43,203
any combination of these with eigenvalue minus one

794
00:51:43,273 --> 00:51:45,346
Any one of them acts on the singlet state

795
00:51:45,454 --> 00:51:47,477
gets back minus the singlet state

796
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:51,332
Any combination of them will get back minus singlet state

797
00:51:51,436 --> 00:51:54,938
So in particular if I take this object here

798
00:51:55,043 --> 00:51:59,605
the singlet state is also an eigenvector of this

799
00:51:59,712 --> 00:52:02,353
Now this is a funny thing

800
00:52:02,464 --> 00:52:06,637
Alice and Bob can't easily measure this whole quantity here

801
00:52:06,735 --> 00:52:12,930
Why? because Alice can't measure Tau X and Tau Y simultaneously

802
00:52:13,038 --> 00:52:17,843
By separate measurements  this would be hard to measure

803
00:52:17,951 --> 00:52:20,837
It can't be measured by separate measurements

804
00:52:20,944 --> 00:52:23,866
Why? Because no separate measurement

805
00:52:23,977 --> 00:52:26,570
can measure Tau X and Tau Y at the same time

806
00:52:26,665 --> 00:52:27,960
or Tau Z at the same time

807
00:52:28,068 --> 00:52:31,986
But this object is a perfectly good Hermitian operator

808
00:52:32,095 --> 00:52:35,050
and there must exist a way of measuring it

809
00:52:35,158 --> 00:52:37,288
But more to the point right now

810
00:52:37,397 --> 00:52:40,141
there's a way of preparing a state

811
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:43,351
which is an eigenvector of this

812
00:52:43,453 --> 00:52:44,644
Now  what's state?

813
00:52:44,718 --> 00:52:45,645
The singlet state

814
00:52:45,725 --> 00:52:49,655
The singlet state is an eigenvector of the object

815
00:52:49,656 --> 00:52:51,573
with eigenvalue minus three

816
00:52:51,653 --> 00:52:55,014
It's an eigenvalue of this one with minus one  this one with minus one

817
00:52:55,122 --> 00:52:56,862
and this one with minus one

818
00:52:56,971 --> 00:52:59,375
The whole thing has eigenvalue minus three

819
00:52:59,487 --> 00:53:05,864
The point is the eigenvectors of this product  of a sum of products here

820
00:53:05,968 --> 00:53:10,356
include the the singlet state is a particular one

821
00:53:10,465 --> 00:53:11,311
You can also write this

822
00:53:11,419 --> 00:53:15,056
It's just Sigma dot Tau

823
00:53:15,163 --> 00:53:19,194
Sigma X Tau X  Sigma Y Tau Y   Sigma Z Tau Z

824
00:53:19,278 --> 00:53:23,813
that uses ordinary classical vectors you are writing Sigma dot Tau

825
00:53:23,915 --> 00:53:27,110
Now if you take two electrons  each one has a spin

826
00:53:27,218 --> 00:53:31,230
In a very very far apart  they don't interact with each other

827
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:36,087
There is no energy associated with the interaction between them

828
00:53:36,197 --> 00:53:39,042
But as you bring them together  there are all sorts of energies

829
00:53:39,134 --> 00:53:42,381
One energy for example is just Coulomb energy between them

830
00:53:42,488 --> 00:53:44,088
Product of the charges

831
00:53:44,161 --> 00:53:48,131
There is also an energy associated with the spins

832
00:53:48,215 --> 00:53:50,723
and one of the terms of the energy associated with the spin

833
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:52,872
is just the dot product of the spins

834
00:53:52,971 --> 00:53:54,648
The spins are aligned  you get

835
00:53:54,717 --> 00:53:58,248
If this is aligned  you get one value

836
00:53:58,357 --> 00:54:01,140
If this is anti-aligned  you get the other value

837
00:54:01,247 --> 00:54:11,805
Ang so Sigma dot tau is a piece of the Hamiltonian of the two spin system

838
00:54:11,908 --> 00:54:15,818
In the singlet state  it's minimum

839
00:54:15,891 --> 00:54:18,429
The three other states called the triplet states

840
00:54:18,542 --> 00:54:22,246
in which it is maximum

841
00:54:22,353 --> 00:54:26,073
So the energy is lowest in the singlet state

842
00:54:26,176 --> 00:54:30,338
The spins are trying to get anti-aligned with each other

843
00:54:30,445 --> 00:54:34,440
But in every direction  not just the z direction  every direction

844
00:54:34,547 --> 00:54:37,518
and eventually compromise on the singlet state

845
00:54:37,662 --> 00:54:42,714
So you have two energy levels associated with the spin of an electron

846
00:54:42,856 --> 00:54:46,136
These two energy in hydrogen

847
00:54:46,238 --> 00:54:48,785
Or in a Positronium   even better

848
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:52,065
In Positronium  you have the aligned and anti-aligned spins

849
00:54:52,212 --> 00:54:56,630
and they have different energy levels  singlet  triplet

850
00:54:56,738 --> 00:55:01,623
If you bring two electrons together

851
00:55:01,768 --> 00:55:06,064
then any state can be written in terms of the singlet triplet states

852
00:55:06,172 --> 00:55:10,913
Even a product state can be represented as a sum of singlet triplet states

853
00:55:11,017 --> 00:55:16,936
What happens when you bring electrons together after a period

854
00:55:17,043 --> 00:55:21,275
if they are in the triplet state with the high energy?

855
00:55:21,389 --> 00:55:25,901
What happens the higher energy states after a while?

856
00:55:25,983 --> 00:55:29,796
They emit a photon and go to the lower energy state

857
00:55:29,869 --> 00:55:34,361
So if you take two spins which may be in a product state

858
00:55:34,472 --> 00:55:36,828
And  you bring them together and wait a long time

859
00:55:36,969 --> 00:55:40,077
a photon may or may not be admitted

860
00:55:40,215 --> 00:55:44,430
If the system is in the singlet state  no emission

861
00:55:44,535 --> 00:55:47,885
If it's in the triplet state it emits  gives off a photon

862
00:55:47,994 --> 00:55:50,293
and winds up in the singlet state

863
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:53,288
So this would be a way of preparing the system

864
00:55:53,397 --> 00:55:54,738
in the singlet state

865
00:55:54,839 --> 00:55:57,966
We just take the two electrons and wait until they radiate a photon

866
00:55:58,041 --> 00:56:01,226
Wait long enough  they do or don't radiate a photon

867
00:56:01,332 --> 00:56:06,971
But if you wait long enough  you'll know that it's in the singlet state

868
00:56:07,078 --> 00:56:10,658
So that's A experiment  that's an experiment 

869
00:56:10,769 --> 00:56:17,077
Another way  now this one so this one is very very far-fetched

870
00:56:17,152 --> 00:56:19,384
extremely far-fetched

871
00:56:19,454 --> 00:56:22,634
The energy in the singlet state is less than the energy

872
00:56:22,741 --> 00:56:24,149
and the other three states

873
00:56:24,256 --> 00:56:28,028
There are four possible states altogether

874
00:56:28,116 --> 00:56:31,723
four possible basis states singlet and three triplet

875
00:56:31,867 --> 00:56:35,076
The energy of the singlet is lowest

876
00:56:35,184 --> 00:56:37,547
So you just take your composite system

877
00:56:37,619 --> 00:56:41,333
and you put it on a scale and you measure its mass

878
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,914
Mass is energy

879
00:56:43,058 --> 00:56:44,523
When you measured its mass

880
00:56:44,633 --> 00:56:48,491
you measured whether it's energy is the energy of the singlet state

881
00:56:48,603 --> 00:56:50,218
or the triplet state

882
00:56:50,327 --> 00:56:55,820
and that constitute a measurement or constitutes a preparation device

883
00:56:55,929 --> 00:57:00,703
are measurement of   basically its variable

884
00:57:00,777 --> 00:57:04,346
but if you like the difference between singlet triplet

885
00:57:04,435 --> 00:57:08,383
So  yeah  there are ways of preparing systems in the singlet or triplet

886
00:57:08,455 --> 00:57:10,010
in singlet state

887
00:57:10,116 --> 00:57:15,036
Always  in fact  if you bring the systems together and you wait a while

888
00:57:15,132 --> 00:57:19,665
it's very difficult to have anything but the singlet state

889
00:57:19,772 --> 00:57:22,570
Then once you've made that singlet state

890
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:25,601
if you grab the electrons without turning the spins

891
00:57:25,704 --> 00:57:27,273
if you grab them somehow in a way

892
00:57:27,350 --> 00:57:31,365
that doesn't put any torque on the spins and pull them apart

893
00:57:31,466 --> 00:57:37,137
You now have two separate electrons for example  in the singlet state

894
00:57:37,211 --> 00:57:40,484
So it's not a terribly hard thing to do

895
00:57:40,589 --> 00:57:46,752
>> With the spin value  actual you can assign the energy to the entanglement

896
00:57:46,859 --> 00:57:50,968
Yes  in this case  yes  in this case  yes

897
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:59,668
But  well you what you can say is the lower energy is certainly entangled

898
00:57:59,778 --> 00:58:01,933
The lowest energy state  the one that seeks

899
00:58:02,019 --> 00:58:04,716
the one to get to by

900
00:58:04,795 --> 00:58:06,987
It doesn't have to be radiating a photon

901
00:58:07,092 --> 00:58:12,463
Any mechanism by which the system can lower its energy

902
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:17,989
emitting a phonon   or doing interacting with the crystal lattice

903
00:58:18,092 --> 00:58:22,072
anything to lower its energy will leave in the singlet state

904
00:58:22,213 --> 00:58:25,538
So I think the right thing to say is

905
00:58:25,657 --> 00:58:29,551
that the lower energy state is entangled

906
00:58:29,695 --> 00:58:32,021
That's almost always the case

907
00:58:32,122 --> 00:58:42,120
that the states of lowest energy are highly entangled between systems

908
00:58:42,229 --> 00:58:47,648
Okay  so we  next question  is there a measure

909
00:58:47,759 --> 00:58:51,841
a quantitative measure of the degree of entanglement

910
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:59,887
is there a way of taking a state and determining whether it's an entangled

911
00:59:00,038 --> 00:59:03,563
and to measure how much entangled

912
00:59:03,672 --> 00:59:06,648
That brings us to a concept called the density matrix

913
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:08,084
which I am probably gonna

914
00:59:08,191 --> 00:59:15,971
It's getting later than I thought so I want to go over this little quickly

915
00:59:16,043 --> 00:59:21,308
but I think we can we can do it

916
00:59:21,384 --> 00:59:26,375
Let's define an object called Alice's density matrix

917
00:59:26,451 --> 00:59:31,334
Alice's density matrix is a quantity

918
00:59:31,415 --> 00:59:36,554
which even in an entangled state is as complete a description

919
00:59:36,696 --> 00:59:41,185
of Alice's system for the purposes of Alice's measurements

920
00:59:41,294 --> 00:59:43,636
as Alice can ever get

921
00:59:43,784 --> 00:59:48,320
It's not a wave function if it was unentangled

922
00:59:48,393 --> 00:59:51,523
the wave function would be the best description she could have

923
00:59:51,628 --> 00:59:55,360
But for an entangled system you cannot extract out

924
00:59:55,468 --> 00:59:58,556
a wave function for either piece of the entangled system

925
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:02,579
The best you could do is something called the of the density matrix

926
01:00:02,683 --> 01:00:04,236
We actually had it up here

927
01:00:04,345 --> 01:00:06,091
Let me go back to it

928
01:00:06,201 --> 01:00:09,801
Let's talk about all of Alice's experiments

929
01:00:09,884 --> 01:00:13,526
that she can do without measuring anything

930
01:00:13,592 --> 01:00:16,947
about Bob's electron or Bob's system

931
01:00:17,048 --> 01:00:19,861
Let's imagine they separated the systems

932
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:21,890
Bob has his Alice has her

933
01:00:21,961 --> 01:00:24,746
and Alice can do all the experiments she likes

934
01:00:24,894 --> 01:00:27,830
and measure any one of these L observables

935
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:31,727
L standing for Alice  Ok

936
01:00:31,831 --> 01:00:37,616
How does she describe all the possible expectation values of everything

937
01:00:37,686 --> 01:00:38,718
that she can ever measure

938
01:00:38,774 --> 01:00:39,931
So we had a formula before

939
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,875
I am going to rewrite it

940
01:00:41,979 --> 01:00:53,512
Expectation value of L is psi star of alpha prime  Beta prime 

941
01:00:55,135 --> 01:00:59,079
Or a prime  b prime

942
01:00:59,192 --> 01:01:00,643
This is the combined system

943
01:01:00,714 --> 01:01:02,838
We are going back to the combined system now

944
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:12,829
L a prime a psi a b

945
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:17,856
But we set b is equal to b prime

946
01:01:17,963 --> 01:01:20,083
Or we like  we can leave the b prime here

947
01:01:20,189 --> 01:01:24,001
And put a Kronecker Delta b and b prime

948
01:01:24,071 --> 01:01:30,042
This is one of Alice's variables  and so as far as Bob goes

949
01:01:30,149 --> 01:01:31,519
it's just a unit operator

950
01:01:31,626 --> 01:01:34,316
It does nothing for Bob's piece of the wave function

951
01:01:34,424 --> 01:01:38,304
and that just says  stick b equal to b prime

952
01:01:38,383 --> 01:01:41,209
Okay look at this quantity right over here

953
01:01:41,316 --> 01:01:43,201
Let's take L on the outside

954
01:01:43,311 --> 01:01:47,481
Let's take L of a prime and a out there  isolated off

955
01:01:47,586 --> 01:01:51,519
We have to sum this over b

956
01:01:51,625 --> 01:01:52,913
We sum over everything

957
01:01:53,021 --> 01:02:00,181
We sum this over b and here is a quantity right here

958
01:02:00,256 --> 01:02:04,777
that depends on a prime a and a multiply something else

959
01:02:04,886 --> 01:02:06,744
that depends on a and a prime

960
01:02:06,869 --> 01:02:09,840
But it doesn't depend on b   we've summed over b

961
01:02:09,981 --> 01:02:14,465
Once you summed over b  it doesn't depend on b anymore

962
01:02:14,572 --> 01:02:16,694
So this object over here is a function

963
01:02:16,834 --> 01:02:21,387
only of Alice's coordinates a and a prime

964
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:24,660
It of course to calculate it

965
01:02:24,769 --> 01:02:26,839
you may have to know more about the wave function

966
01:02:26,924 --> 01:02:29,313
But once you've calculated it

967
01:02:29,384 --> 01:02:32,028
that's all that Alice ever needs to know

968
01:02:32,117 --> 01:02:35,592
to calculate anything about her half of the system

969
01:02:35,698 --> 01:02:37,280
So let's give it a name

970
01:02:37,387 --> 01:02:48,636
It's the sum over b  psi star of a prime b  psi of a b

971
01:02:48,745 --> 01:02:51,371
It doesn't depend on b degrees of freedom at all anymore

972
01:02:51,478 --> 01:02:53,004
Bob's degrees of freedom

973
01:02:53,091 --> 01:02:55,861
It's called the density matrix

974
01:02:55,964 --> 01:03:00,625
That's a function  a thing which depends on a prime and a

975
01:03:00,718 --> 01:03:04,454
It's a matrix  it's a matrix that has two entries

976
01:03:04,598 --> 01:03:13,336
Any matrix can be thought of as a function of a row and a column

977
01:03:13,429 --> 01:03:15,260
This is a density matrix

978
01:03:15,363 --> 01:03:17,113
and if we know the density matrix

979
01:03:17,223 --> 01:03:19,236
it doesn't matter where it came from

980
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:22,805
It doesn't matter what Bob state was if we know row in a row

981
01:03:22,910 --> 01:03:26,002
Then we know that the expectation is right the formula

982
01:03:26,114 --> 01:03:28,583
The expectation value of L is equal to

983
01:03:28,682 --> 01:03:37,349
the sum of rho of a prime and a  L of a and a prime

984
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:38,791
I think I have one of them backwards

985
01:03:38,888 --> 01:03:41,003
It doesn't matter

986
01:03:41,147 --> 01:03:44,579
So Alice  if she knew this density matrix

987
01:03:44,688 --> 01:03:47,251
could forget about Bob completely

988
01:03:47,354 --> 01:03:51,837
and say I know everything there is to know about my subsystem

989
01:03:51,944 --> 01:03:55,981
and here it is  Ok

990
01:03:56,088 --> 01:04:05,707
What is rho of a and a prime if we start with a pure state

991
01:04:05,815 --> 01:04:11,802
Supposing we started with a pure state

992
01:04:11,879 --> 01:04:13,825
You are getting exhausted?

993
01:04:13,930 --> 01:04:20,064
No? This is quantum mechanics for you  sorry  but this is it

994
01:04:20,173 --> 01:04:23,117
>> (laugh)

995
01:04:23,216 --> 01:04:25,219
I can't make it easier

996
01:04:25,327 --> 01:04:27,605
This is the easiest I can make it

997
01:04:27,695 --> 01:04:30,363
Alright  you are going to sit down with it  you'll go through it

998
01:04:30,470 --> 01:04:33,000
and penetrate it

999
01:04:33,071 --> 01:04:38,091
But I'll do my best  okay.

1000
01:04:38,159 --> 01:04:43,581
This is the notion of density matrix

1001
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:48,922
What if psi is a pure state?

1002
01:04:49,024 --> 01:04:51,774
What can we say about this density matrix?

1003
01:04:51,879 --> 01:04:55,177
So let's go back and see exactly what it says

1004
01:04:55,282 --> 01:04:56,954
If psi is  I am sorry

1005
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:59,035
What if psi is a product state

1006
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:03,371
If psi is a product state it means the wave function factorizes

1007
01:05:03,479 --> 01:05:04,983
So let's go back  here we are

1008
01:05:05,088 --> 01:05:07,215
Here is the density matrix

1009
01:05:07,359 --> 01:05:11,386
The wave function factorizes into  this is a b prime

1010
01:05:11,487 --> 01:05:12,630
That's right  that's correct

1011
01:05:12,706 --> 01:05:17,370
>>The density matrix you summed over a prime and a is a double sum

1012
01:05:17,482 --> 01:05:19,320
Not in the density matrix

1013
01:05:19,428 --> 01:05:20,273
>>Why

1014
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:23,435
In this one  yes  it's a double sum

1015
01:05:23,541 --> 01:05:26,127
It's a double sum but only involves rho

1016
01:05:26,233 --> 01:05:29,626
So let's erase this for a moment

1017
01:05:29,672 --> 01:05:33,229
and see what we learn about this creature called the density matrix

1018
01:05:33,309 --> 01:05:35,453
if psi is a product vector

1019
01:05:35,561 --> 01:05:37,972
It must have is a special form somehow

1020
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:45,850
So let's say that psi is a product of Alice's wave function

1021
01:05:45,931 --> 01:05:47,155
times Bob's wave function

1022
01:05:47,229 --> 01:05:48,396
I forget which one is which now

1023
01:05:48,465 --> 01:05:50,715
Was psi Alice or psi Bob?

1024
01:05:50,804 --> 01:05:52,774
Psi with Bob?

1025
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:55,520
Psi is Alice  Ok

1026
01:05:55,628 --> 01:05:58,203
It doesn't matter  we can change it now

1027
01:05:58,310 --> 01:06:07,224
So the complex conjugate here is Alice's wave function times

1028
01:06:07,333 --> 01:06:08,540
This is not the wave function of Alice's

1029
01:06:08,801 --> 01:06:11,265
This is the wave function of Alice's spin  incidentally

1030
01:06:11,353 --> 01:06:13,058
But I will call it as Alice's wave function

1031
01:06:13,826 --> 01:06:18,428
Alice's wave function times Bob's wave function  the complex conjugate

1032
01:06:18,472 --> 01:06:25,853
And then we multiply that by the non complex conjugate of thing

1033
01:06:25,874 --> 01:06:27,472
Let me put them in the opposite order

1034
01:06:27,530 --> 01:06:31,753
Phi of b  notice we identified b with b here

1035
01:06:31,781 --> 01:06:38,554
It's not b and b prime  and this is prime  Psi a

1036
01:06:39,844 --> 01:06:42,315
Each one of these factorizes 

1037
01:06:42,426 --> 01:06:45,158
this factorizes into a function of 'a prime' and b

1038
01:06:45,226 --> 01:06:46,551
And this one into a function of b and a

1039
01:06:49,439 --> 01:06:50,991
And now we sum over b

1040
01:06:52,002 --> 01:06:56,611
What does this sum of b? Of Phi star phi? One right?

1041
01:06:56,631 --> 01:07:00,140
Okay so now we can take this out  throw it out

1042
01:07:01,181 --> 01:07:05,452
And here is what we find  we find that for a product state 

1043
01:07:05,473 --> 01:07:07,164
Only for product state  

1044
01:07:07,248 --> 01:07:14,399
that Rho is simply made up out of Alice's half of the wave function

1045
01:07:14,422 --> 01:07:18,658
Without any regard to Bob  she doesn't need to know anything about Bob

1046
01:07:20,087 --> 01:07:23,709
This is not too surprising that she didn't need to know anything about Bob

1047
01:07:23,772 --> 01:07:26,755
After all it's a product wave function 

1048
01:07:26,830 --> 01:07:36,032
And the density matrix is just a product of the complex conjugate 

1049
01:07:36,076 --> 01:07:38,175
of the wave function with the wave function itself 

1050
01:07:38,247 --> 01:07:41,455
Two different a-s though  an a and a prime

1051
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:47,481
Alright what can we say about a matrix like this

1052
01:07:47,509 --> 01:07:49,604
Let's call this matrix  let's call it

1053
01:07:50,305 --> 01:07:54,967
I think it's actually Rho of  let's call it Rho of a and a prime

1054
01:07:55,823 --> 01:08:00,706
Just call it Rho of a and switch the order  but that's just the definition

1055
01:08:00,737 --> 01:08:07,692
Let's take this Rho  it's a matrix and act with it on a column vector 

1056
01:08:07,725 --> 01:08:11,253
How do you act if you know the components of a matrix

1057
01:08:11,357 --> 01:08:15,109
How do you act on a column vector? So let's suppose this is a matrix

1058
01:08:16,293 --> 01:08:22,597
Ya Rho 11  just a second  Rho 12 so forth  Rho 21 

1059
01:08:22,666 --> 01:08:24,822
we made a matrix out of it

1060
01:08:24,897 --> 01:08:27,469
>> Do you wanna erase the transformation sign there on the far?

1061
01:08:27,548 --> 01:08:32,985
Ya I do  good point  excellent 

1062
01:08:34,218 --> 01:08:38,606
Alright so we have Rho  it's made up out of Alice's wave function

1063
01:08:40,110 --> 01:08:43,622
And I maintain that this density matrix  

1064
01:08:43,722 --> 01:08:47,183
All of these matrix has an eigenvector 

1065
01:08:48,536 --> 01:08:52,623
I maintain all over that there is one and only one eigenvector

1066
01:08:52,653 --> 01:08:55,175
With non zero eigenvalue 

1067
01:08:55,264 --> 01:09:07,444
And that the eigenvalue is plus one  somebody say right? Good

1068
01:09:07,470 --> 01:09:12,149
Okay  let's prove it  I will tell you exactly what that eigenvector is 

1069
01:09:12,177 --> 01:09:18,953
It's Psi a  it's Psi itself  so let's check that out

1070
01:09:18,977 --> 01:09:23,967
Let's multiply this by Psi of a prime in fact 

1071
01:09:24,012 --> 01:09:26,822
And sum it over a prime  this is matrix  

1072
01:09:26,879 --> 01:09:32,202
this is the process of multiplying a column vector by a matrix

1073
01:09:32,247 --> 01:09:36,452
That's the way you do it  you write down the matrix 

1074
01:09:36,543 --> 01:09:44,191
You write down the column vector and you sum over the element between them

1075
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:47,975
Okay let's see if we can see what we get

1076
01:09:48,063 --> 01:09:54,682
Oh this is the action of Rho on Psi  okay

1077
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:57,348
So let's do it  Rho is Rho

1078
01:09:58,754 --> 01:10:04,952
Now let's multiply it by Psi of a prime

1079
01:10:07,210 --> 01:10:11,098
And now let's sum over a prime  what do we get?

1080
01:10:13,394 --> 01:10:19,875
Psi star of a prime times Psi of a prime sum over a prime is? One  right?

1081
01:10:19,896 --> 01:10:23,283
So it all comes out to just be Psi

1082
01:10:23,364 --> 01:10:25,539
So this is Psi  

1083
01:10:28,275 --> 01:10:29,675
What does that tell you about eigenvector

1084
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:33,614
and eigenvalues of the density matrix?

1085
01:10:33,828 --> 01:10:37,283
It tells you that the original wave function is 

1086
01:10:37,354 --> 01:10:41,165
an eigenvalue of the density matrix of eigenvalue plus one 

1087
01:10:43,002 --> 01:10:46,910
Let me prove now that all vectors perpendicular 

1088
01:10:46,936 --> 01:10:50,343
There are n minus one if the dimensionality of the space is n

1089
01:10:50,422 --> 01:10:55,987
Then this is the one eigenvector out of n  which is eigenvalue one

1090
01:10:56,013 --> 01:10:59,759
Let's take any vector now which is perpendicular

1091
01:10:59,866 --> 01:11:02,924
which is orthogonal to Psi

1092
01:11:03,034 --> 01:11:05,537
To Psi a  to Alice's wave function 

1093
01:11:05,649 --> 01:11:09,656
Let's call it Psi a tilde  

1094
01:11:09,686 --> 01:11:14,134
tilde now means it's orthogonal to the original Alice' vector

1095
01:11:14,172 --> 01:11:20,366
Now what is this inner product? Zero right?

1096
01:11:22,046 --> 01:11:29,171
So we find out that Rho on Psi tilde is zero

1097
01:11:29,207 --> 01:11:33,843
That means any vector perpendicular to Alice's vector 

1098
01:11:33,938 --> 01:11:37,099
is an eigenvector with eigenvalue zero

1099
01:11:37,195 --> 01:11:44,850
The original state of Alice's spin is an eigenvalue with plus one 

1100
01:11:44,876 --> 01:11:50,181
Conclusion? The density matrix for a pure state has one 

1101
01:11:50,275 --> 01:11:54,300
and only one non zero eigenvalue and it's equal to one

1102
01:11:59,727 --> 01:12:03,060
What if it's not a product state?

1103
01:12:03,932 --> 01:12:12,881
If it's not a product state then you will find a collection of eigenvalues

1104
01:12:12,938 --> 01:12:16,611
In fact in general there will be all of the eigenvalues

1105
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:19,246
in general with non-zero

1106
01:12:20,241 --> 01:12:27,715
Of the density matrix  you can try this out for the two spin system

1107
01:12:27,741 --> 01:12:31,605
Work out the density matrix of Alice's spin

1108
01:12:31,749 --> 01:12:34,058
the density matrix for Bob's spin

1109
01:12:34,164 --> 01:12:36,937
And you will find out that they are quite different

1110
01:12:37,057 --> 01:12:39,137
They don't have the single eigenvector which is non-zero 

1111
01:12:39,210 --> 01:12:41,714
They have a pair of eigenvectors which are non-zero 

1112
01:12:41,810 --> 01:12:47,979
So what we learn is that this information in the density matrix 

1113
01:12:48,007 --> 01:12:51,460
and in particular in the eigenvalues of the density matrix 

1114
01:12:51,532 --> 01:12:54,943
Which tell you whether it's a great deal of entanglement or not

1115
01:12:56,084 --> 01:12:59,060
The more eigenvectors which are non zero 

1116
01:12:59,123 --> 01:13:01,275
The more entangled it is 

1117
01:13:01,332 --> 01:13:03,960
If there is only one eigenvector which is non zero 

1118
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:06,318
It's not entangled at all

1119
01:13:07,178 --> 01:13:13,238
And Alice's half of the wave function is just that eigenvector

1120
01:13:14,438 --> 01:13:19,519
If they are entangled then one finds the more they are entangled 

1121
01:13:19,551 --> 01:13:21,897
the more eigenvalues you'll find 

1122
01:13:23,220 --> 01:13:26,672
And the maximum entanglement is when all the eigenvectors are equal 

1123
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:29,418
When all the eigenvectors are equal  all eigenvalues  

1124
01:13:29,796 --> 01:13:34,981
when all the eigenvalues are equal  that's maximal entanglement 

1125
01:13:35,366 --> 01:13:42,361
Take the singlet state  work out the density matrix of Alice's spin

1126
01:13:42,741 --> 01:13:47,029
And what you will find is that it has two eigenvalues 

1127
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:51,743
Each of which is a half  equal and equal to a half 

1128
01:13:52,213 --> 01:13:56,596
So that's a test  that's the way to test 

1129
01:13:56,947 --> 01:13:59,882
whether the system does or doesn't have entanglement 

1130
01:14:00,203 --> 01:14:04,325
Calculate the density matrix and study it's eigenvalues

1131
01:14:04,650 --> 01:14:07,557
The maximum entanglement is when they are all equal

1132
01:14:09,183 --> 01:14:14,174
When they are equal  they are equal to one over n  you can prove that

1133
01:14:14,543 --> 01:14:18,728
When n is the dimensionality of the space  one over n

1134
01:14:20,492 --> 01:14:25,294
Okay that's entanglement quantified

1135
01:14:28,814 --> 01:14:30,717
can even be a little more quantitative

1136
01:14:31,084 --> 01:14:33,350
Even be a little more quantitative 

1137
01:14:38,619 --> 01:14:39,958
No  let's not do that now

1138
01:14:40,323 --> 01:14:43,038
I will write a more quantitative condition of notes

1139
01:14:56,694 --> 01:14:59,425
Let's very quickly go through the connection

1140
01:14:59,772 --> 01:15:01,498
between measurement and entanglement 

1141
01:15:01,781 --> 01:15:03,993
There is a deep connection between measurement and entanglement 

1142
01:15:04,375 --> 01:15:08,161
Basically measurement is the process of entangling  

1143
01:15:08,503 --> 01:15:12,345
of starting with a product state  a product state of what and what 

1144
01:15:12,704 --> 01:15:16,338
A product state of a system and the apparatus

1145
01:15:16,695 --> 01:15:20,106
The apparatus is in a definite state to begin with

1146
01:15:20,417 --> 01:15:22,146
And the system is in definite state 

1147
01:15:22,477 --> 01:15:24,426
What state is the apparatus in?

1148
01:15:24,789 --> 01:15:29,105
Well  the apparatus might be something which detect something or other

1149
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:32,360
and if it's not detecting  you might put it into some neutral state 

1150
01:15:32,699 --> 01:15:35,217
some neutral state which is the starting state  the undetected state

1151
01:15:37,335 --> 01:15:38,744
the neutral state of the apparatus 

1152
01:15:39,098 --> 01:15:42,289
And now you bring the system you are interested in

1153
01:15:42,646 --> 01:15:46,119
Right up to the apparatus  it does something to the apparatus

1154
01:15:46,452 --> 01:15:48,175
Something happens to the system itself 

1155
01:15:48,538 --> 01:15:52,401
And what's left over is an entangled state between the two of them

1156
01:15:52,740 --> 01:15:53,777
So I'll give you an example

1157
01:15:54,162 --> 01:15:57,744
I'm going to think of the apparatus as a very simple system

1158
01:15:58,061 --> 01:15:59,186
With only two states

1159
01:16:03,041 --> 01:16:04,944
Let's  let me find my notes here

1160
01:16:13,521 --> 01:16:17,694
Ya  my system is a spin and my apparatus also happens

1161
01:16:17,994 --> 01:16:19,210
to have only two states

1162
01:16:19,488 --> 01:16:20,502
You can think of it as another spin if you like 

1163
01:16:21,854 --> 01:16:23,846
In fact they could be Alice's and Bob's

1164
01:16:24,175 --> 01:16:27,527
But you could also think of it as a more complex system

1165
01:16:29,637 --> 01:16:32,039
But for simplicity it only has two states

1166
01:16:34,975 --> 01:16:41,663
Here's the apparatus  it has only two states  let's say zero and one now

1167
01:16:42,011 --> 01:16:47,381
Zero is the state before the apparatus is switch on  when it's switch on 

1168
01:16:47,724 --> 01:16:52,646
It has not detected anything  it always starts out in the state zero 

1169
01:16:53,005 --> 01:16:55,190
And if it's not in the state zero give it a shove

1170
01:16:55,541 --> 01:16:57,104
and put it in the state zero

1171
01:16:57,437 --> 01:17:01,285
Otherwise it's not  otherwise  you know  

1172
01:17:01,646 --> 01:17:03,644
you have to start your apparatus in a know state

1173
01:17:04,011 --> 01:17:05,971
Otherwise you are not going to be able to do a measurement 

1174
01:17:06,308 --> 01:17:09,418
So it has zero and one  for it starts out zero

1175
01:17:09,772 --> 01:17:14,244
And we have our spin  here's a spin

1176
01:17:14,585 --> 01:17:15,876
and we are gonna do a measurement on it

1177
01:17:16,217 --> 01:17:20,451
Supposing the spin is in the up state  

1178
01:17:22,524 --> 01:17:25,573
and the apparatus of course begins in the zero state

1179
01:17:25,914 --> 01:17:29,266
So we represent that by a combined ket vector 

1180
01:17:29,575 --> 01:17:35,380
A combined ket vector is in a tensor product of the spin Hilbert space 

1181
01:17:35,724 --> 01:17:37,269
and the detector Hilbert space

1182
01:17:38,796 --> 01:17:44,737
Up and zero  if the spin comes in  to begin with down

1183
01:17:46,121 --> 01:17:49,464
And then you start out in the state down zero

1184
01:17:52,176 --> 01:17:56,460
Why? Because you start out with a detector in the neutral state 

1185
01:17:58,037 --> 01:18:02,056
Now I'm not going to tell you in detail what the interaction is 

1186
01:18:02,410 --> 01:18:05,006
between the detector and the spin

1187
01:18:05,350 --> 01:18:09,357
That could involve magnetic fields and other kinds of things

1188
01:18:09,688 --> 01:18:12,086
causing an influence between the detector 

1189
01:18:12,423 --> 01:18:16,852
But I am going to tell you  that if you bring a spin into the detector

1190
01:18:17,189 --> 01:18:19,836
And then take a spin out of the detector

1191
01:18:20,210 --> 01:18:23,444
I'll tell you what state is left over

1192
01:18:23,809 --> 01:18:27,405
So in particular  and I am making this up of course 

1193
01:18:27,713 --> 01:18:32,791
I am making up a rule which would be a good detector

1194
01:18:33,123 --> 01:18:34,671
Which would be a good detector

1195
01:18:34,969 --> 01:18:40,049
Namely  if the spin  if the system starts  

1196
01:18:40,378 --> 01:18:43,346
that the combined system starts in the state |u zero>

1197
01:18:43,687 --> 01:18:51,365
Then the detector feels the spin and it jumps to state one

1198
01:18:51,681 --> 01:18:55,237
It goes to state |u one>

1199
01:18:55,535 --> 01:19:01,568
Nothing happens to the spin  it just activates the detector 

1200
01:19:01,930 --> 01:19:06,806
On the other hand  if the spin is down  it doesn't activate the detector

1201
01:19:07,113 --> 01:19:15,515
That's my rule  so this goes to |down one>  no |down zero>  |down zero>

1202
01:19:18,703 --> 01:19:21,178
And that's a very good detector of up-ness and down-ness

1203
01:19:21,502 --> 01:19:25,459
But now let's start with a superposition of up and down

1204
01:19:25,803 --> 01:19:36,123
Let's take alpha up times |up> plus alpha down times |down>

1205
01:19:36,453 --> 01:19:39,835
Somebody now brought us a spin and they superposition its state

1206
01:19:40,152 --> 01:19:44,063
A general quantum state  but of course the detector starts out zero

1207
01:19:47,744 --> 01:19:53,270
So that's the starting state  what happens after the detector acts?

1208
01:19:53,616 --> 01:19:59,099
Well if the state is |u zero>  it goes to |u one>

1209
01:19:59,452 --> 01:20:05,390
So that means it goes to alpha sub u times |u one>

1210
01:20:07,304 --> 01:20:15,581
Plus alpha sub down |down zero>

1211
01:20:20,236 --> 01:20:22,260
This all of a sudden has become an entangled state

1212
01:20:22,621 --> 01:20:28,939
It's an entangled state if it's up  if the spin is up  the detector is up

1213
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:30,323
The detector is one 

1214
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:34,275
If the spin is down  the detector is zero 

1215
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:38,503
That is an entangled state  why is it an entangled state 

1216
01:20:38,855 --> 01:20:41,868
It's an entangled state because by looking at the detector 

1217
01:20:42,216 --> 01:20:44,132
You can tell what the spin is doing 

1218
01:20:44,431 --> 01:20:46,307
In fact that is what a measurement is 

1219
01:20:46,609 --> 01:20:50,404
A measurement is an interaction between a system and an apparatus

1220
01:20:50,725 --> 01:20:57,308
that leaves the apparatus in a state that depends on the 

1221
01:20:57,642 --> 01:21:00,227
whatever it is measuring about the system 

1222
01:21:01,476 --> 01:21:03,171
So from one point of view you can just say

1223
01:21:03,509 --> 01:21:05,827
Well look  this is exactly what I knew a measurement always was

1224
01:21:07,587 --> 01:21:09,955
It just  it leaves  

1225
01:21:10,265 --> 01:21:12,060
It's just the process that leaves a record

1226
01:21:12,438 --> 01:21:15,580
on the apparatus of what the initial state was

1227
01:21:15,923 --> 01:21:19,252
Of the spin  but from another point of view 

1228
01:21:19,589 --> 01:21:22,603
It's the physics of a combined system 

1229
01:21:22,943 --> 01:21:25,980
that combined system being a spin and the apparatus 

1230
01:21:26,325 --> 01:21:29,372
Which leaves them in a highly entangled state 

1231
01:21:29,742 --> 01:21:36,167
So entangled that by looking at the detector you can tell what the spin is

1232
01:21:36,507 --> 01:21:40,616
So entanglement and measurement are really the same thing 

1233
01:21:40,943 --> 01:21:46,275
And in fact to measure a spin  you really only need another spin

1234
01:21:46,607 --> 01:21:50,522
And this detector here could just be a spin

1235
01:21:50,852 --> 01:21:53,093
And one and zero could be up and down 

1236
01:21:53,171 --> 01:21:58,601
So we had this kind of concoction here where exactly this happen 

1237
01:21:58,675 --> 01:22:02,579
It would take only one spin to be a detector or an apparatus 

1238
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:05,464
Which could measure another spin

1239
01:22:05,605 --> 01:22:12,844
But in general this is the nature of measurement 

1240
01:22:12,955 --> 01:22:16,360
that it entangles system together 

1241
01:22:16,467 --> 01:22:19,814
that entangles in particular apparatus with the system

1242
01:22:19,921 --> 01:22:33,218
Is that clear? It should be very clear  and that's all

1243
01:22:33,359 --> 01:22:35,035
That's one way of thinking about measurement 

1244
01:22:35,139 --> 01:22:36,642
And in this language in which 

1245
01:22:36,749 --> 01:22:39,398
you think of the system and the apparatus together

1246
01:22:39,498 --> 01:22:42,655
You never speak about the collapse of a wave function 

1247
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:45,641
You speak about the development of entanglement 

1248
01:22:45,751 --> 01:22:50,184
If you don't want to include the apparatus into your system

1249
01:22:50,287 --> 01:22:55,470
Then the only thing to say is that after the experiment is done

1250
01:22:55,579 --> 01:22:58,519
The system is either up or down 

1251
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:03,299
And you get  which one do you pick? You pick the one that you record

1252
01:23:03,669 --> 01:23:06,140
But the one that you record is the one that recorded by the apparatus

1253
01:23:06,489 --> 01:23:10,012
So thinking about just the system by itself

1254
01:23:10,337 --> 01:23:13,368
You will have to have this rule that the wave function collapses

1255
01:23:13,728 --> 01:23:17,968
Thinking about the system plus apparatus  the same physics is described 

1256
01:23:18,377 --> 01:23:22,120
by the development of entanglement between the system and apparatus 

1257
01:23:24,259 --> 01:23:29,275
>> So in that case would be a mixed state  a lot of states

1258
01:23:29,656 --> 01:23:33,051
>> what can you see in the meter of the apparatus  the one that is zero?

1259
01:23:34,442 --> 01:23:42,454
Okay  now you are another detector  this is the hierarchy of detection 

1260
01:23:43,734 --> 01:23:45,550
Or the hierarchy of the measurement

1261
01:23:45,879 --> 01:23:49,430
Here is the spin  here is the apparatus

1262
01:23:49,785 --> 01:23:54,316
But we are not finished  we still have to look at the apparatus

1263
01:23:54,679 --> 01:23:57,236
We haven't gotten any where until we look at the apparatus right?

1264
01:23:57,608 --> 01:23:59,756
Alright  well what's gonna happen?

1265
01:24:00,106 --> 01:24:03,524
Again we are gonna have to say when we look at the apparatus 

1266
01:24:03,852 --> 01:24:06,572
We wind up collapsing the wave function 

1267
01:24:06,909 --> 01:24:09,996
to one of these two pieces of the entangled states

1268
01:24:10,343 --> 01:24:15,987
Or we can say  include the eyeball into the system 

1269
01:24:16,346 --> 01:24:19,778
In that case  we should have included another system here 

1270
01:24:20,110 --> 01:24:24,540
The eyeball  and the eyeball  I don't know  how do they start?

1271
01:24:24,887 --> 01:24:26,284
It started  um  

1272
01:24:33,348 --> 01:24:35,124
It also has two states

1273
01:24:35,411 --> 01:24:39,299
the two states correspond to the two possible answers

1274
01:24:39,603 --> 01:24:43,532
that the brain up there  there is also a brain up here >> oh no

1275
01:24:45,776 --> 01:24:49,052
Two states of the brain  one state of the brain says 

1276
01:24:49,395 --> 01:24:52,941
I saw the apparatus with a zero

1277
01:24:53,277 --> 01:24:57,181
The other state of the brain says I saw the apparatus with a one 

1278
01:24:58,932 --> 01:25:02,468
If we want to include the observer as well as the apparatus 

1279
01:25:02,815 --> 01:25:04,788
We have to include another factor here 

1280
01:25:05,174 --> 01:25:09,240
And that factor has to depend on the state of the brain

1281
01:25:09,590 --> 01:25:12,088
Let's call it b not  it starts b not

1282
01:25:13,976 --> 01:25:16,696
which is the brain before you look at anything

1283
01:25:18,070 --> 01:25:22,643
And then it goes to b one over here or b not over here

1284
01:25:24,115 --> 01:25:28,595
It's now become a system which is entangled with the eye and brain 

1285
01:25:30,716 --> 01:25:32,011
You can say wait a minute now 

1286
01:25:32,379 --> 01:25:35,379
We now have this entangled state we describe it all 

1287
01:25:35,684 --> 01:25:37,628
by the quantum mechanics of the entanglement 

1288
01:25:37,942 --> 01:25:43,142
between spin and apparatus  and then latter on between apparatus spin

1289
01:25:43,458 --> 01:25:46,453
and eyeball  it's all been described by quantum mechanics

1290
01:25:48,022 --> 01:25:49,928
But you may not be satisfied 

1291
01:25:50,327 --> 01:25:53,907
You may worry about if other fellows who comes in  in the room

1292
01:25:54,308 --> 01:25:57,835
Takes a look  and asks you what did you see

1293
01:25:58,203 --> 01:26:05,468
So somebody else comes in  and ask you okay Charlie what did you measure?

1294
01:26:08,660 --> 01:26:17,545
And in the process  collapses the wave function of the spin  apparatus

1295
01:26:17,877 --> 01:26:19,561
What is it's name? Give it a name  

1296
01:26:20,869 --> 01:26:24,018
No  no no  this is Charlie  he comes in afterwards

1297
01:26:24,331 --> 01:26:31,392
Wigner  Wiggy  there was a Wigner that says Schrodinger right?

1298
01:26:32,603 --> 01:26:39,019
So Schrodinger  I don't know  which one of these has ears

1299
01:26:41,819 --> 01:26:44,171
This is the atom  this is the atom 

1300
01:26:44,501 --> 01:26:47,507
The cat  he doesn't look at the atom

1301
01:26:47,805 --> 01:26:51,127
But he gets hit  something happens  something happens to them on the atom

1302
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:55,737
So here's the detector  the cat is the detector

1303
01:26:59,178 --> 01:27:01,162
Here Schrodinger who looks into the box

1304
01:27:01,496 --> 01:27:03,410
here's Wigner who looks at Schrodinger

1305
01:27:03,741 --> 01:27:06,794
And there is a hierarchy here  the hierarchy 

1306
01:27:07,101 --> 01:27:10,151
where you decide to break the hierarchy?

1307
01:27:10,476 --> 01:27:12,114
Where you decide to break the hierarchy 

1308
01:27:13,514 --> 01:27:18,409
determines at what stage you will say the wave function collapse?

1309
01:27:20,418 --> 01:27:25,575
If you like  I suppose at some stage

1310
01:27:25,980 --> 01:27:27,687
you would say the wave function collapse

1311
01:27:28,967 --> 01:27:30,287
When the last person look at it

1312
01:27:30,619 --> 01:27:33,495
But you could always include that last person into the system 

1313
01:27:33,828 --> 01:27:35,807
Then no collapse happens

1314
01:27:36,121 --> 01:27:39,559
but then in order to make sense out of the whole thing

1315
01:27:39,876 --> 01:27:42,783
Again you have to imagine some other person 

1316
01:27:43,072 --> 01:27:46,867
So you always have to imagine a hierarchy of observation 

1317
01:27:48,117 --> 01:27:50,109
And then with such a hierarchy of observation 

1318
01:27:50,441 --> 01:27:56,396
the world is built like a onion  things inside

1319
01:27:56,741 --> 01:27:57,885
next thing out  next thing out

1320
01:27:59,172 --> 01:28:03,105
And each things get to observed   what's the inside of it?

1321
01:28:05,273 --> 01:28:07,633
>>Question  what is the process

1322
01:28:07,941 --> 01:28:10,962
>>when we are moving with the classical world

1323
01:28:11,304 --> 01:28:16,243
>>and one of those people actually see definite items because

1324
01:28:17,396 --> 01:28:26,342
Well I don't know  I don't think there is any sharp line

1325
01:28:26,685 --> 01:28:28,181
I don't think there is any sharp line

1326
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:37,512
We tend to describe a big system as having little uncertainty 

1327
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:45,823
but I'm not sure that anything really different happens 

1328
01:28:46,180 --> 01:28:52,476
When a electron looks at another electron 

1329
01:28:52,816 --> 01:28:55,309
Or when a cat looks at a electron 

1330
01:28:55,638 --> 01:28:58,712
I think the physics or the mathematical description 

1331
01:28:59,037 --> 01:29:03,449
I think it's the same description or at least 

1332
01:29:03,764 --> 01:29:06,904
if we want to say something special happens when the cat looks

1333
01:29:07,279 --> 01:29:08,696
Well it's not well described by quantum mechanics

1334
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:10,876
We have to introduce some thing about cats

1335
01:29:11,229 --> 01:29:15,183
that doesn't contain within quantum mechanics

1336
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:16,585
And personally I don't believe 

1337
01:29:16,898 --> 01:29:18,456
there is anything about cats which is not contained

1338
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:19,747
within quantum mechanics

1339
01:29:20,103 --> 01:29:21,960
So I'm happy with this description 

1340
01:29:22,265 --> 01:29:26,352
I'm happy with this description  what makes me happy is that 

1341
01:29:26,731 --> 01:29:28,877
it doesn't matter where you draw the line

1342
01:29:29,179 --> 01:29:34,433
You can draw the line in one place or the next place or the next place 

1343
01:29:34,712 --> 01:29:36,468
And the result would be consistent 

1344
01:29:36,820 --> 01:29:39,814
If the cat saw the spin up

1345
01:29:40,138 --> 01:29:43,393
Schrodinger would see the cat having seen the spin up

1346
01:29:43,742 --> 01:29:46,331
And Wigner would have seen Schrodinger

1347
01:29:46,608 --> 01:29:48,335
having the cat having seen the spin up

1348
01:29:48,688 --> 01:29:50,991
That's what the nature of the state is 

1349
01:29:51,276 --> 01:29:53,725
So that define satisfyingly 

1350
01:29:54,026 --> 01:29:58,232
that you don't ever have to say where you draw the line

1351
01:29:58,528 --> 01:30:02,231
And until you draw the line  you would put the line as far out as you like

1352
01:30:02,554 --> 01:30:05,605
Until you draw the line  everything is described 

1353
01:30:05,922 --> 01:30:08,360
by the rules of a conventional quantum mechanics

1354
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:12,267
>> So unless you puts the cat  you definitely draw the line 

1355
01:30:13,353 --> 01:30:18,741
Well okay  I mean  look I think at some stage 

1356
01:30:19,083 --> 01:30:21,867
you have to decide for yourself how you think about this 

1357
01:30:22,202 --> 01:30:27,516
I'm not going to try to push my interpretation of quantum mechanics on you

1358
01:30:27,892 --> 01:30:36,235
Particularly since  I don't know what to say about it except this

1359
01:30:37,779 --> 01:30:39,564
That seems to disturb a lot of people 

1360
01:30:39,884 --> 01:30:44,521
This whole business of systems for which 

1361
01:30:44,860 --> 01:30:46,999
you could know as much as can be known

1362
01:30:47,320 --> 01:30:49,055
And know nothing about the parts of the system

1363
01:30:49,349 --> 01:30:50,687
That seems to disturb people

1364
01:30:51,015 --> 01:30:54,007
Is it disturbing? I  

1365
01:30:54,310 --> 01:30:58,054
When Finding() was asked whether he thought 

1366
01:30:58,354 --> 01:30:59,734
there is a problem with quantum mechanics  

1367
01:31:00,036 --> 01:31:02,250
he's answer was that the problem was so big 

1368
01:31:02,555 --> 01:31:03,886
that you could tell if there is a problem

1369
01:31:04,232 --> 01:31:08,065
He knew how to use it  he knew how to predict with it

1370
01:31:08,418 --> 01:31:10,641
He could predict anything he wanted to predict 

1371
01:31:10,975 --> 01:31:15,027
Though that have an answer and he didn't expect 

1372
01:31:15,353 --> 01:31:17,275
I'm not actually speaking about myself now

1373
01:31:17,633 --> 01:31:20,171
But in for him

1374
01:31:20,519 --> 01:31:23,318
he did not expect the quantum mechanics would ever go wrong

1375
01:31:23,653 --> 01:31:26,073
That the rules would always be satisfied  

1376
01:31:26,413 --> 01:31:31,590
but is there a problem because of this sense of unreality 

1377
01:31:31,948 --> 01:31:36,664
about where actual objectively  where objectively does something happen

1378
01:31:36,993 --> 01:31:40,752
Does this objective 'death of the cat' happen

1379
01:31:41,071 --> 01:31:42,973
when the cat looks at the atom

1380
01:31:43,295 --> 01:31:44,811
Or is it when Schrodinger looks at the cat 

1381
01:31:45,152 --> 01:31:46,999
Or was it Wigner looks at Schrodinger 

1382
01:31:47,352 --> 01:31:50,032
Where does the objective phenomena happen?

1383
01:31:50,358 --> 01:31:54,811
And maybe we are just playing with words there 

1384
01:31:55,155 --> 01:31:57,323
Maybe we are playing with words  

1385
01:31:57,665 --> 01:32:00,604
trying to use words in a context where they don't apply

1386
01:32:00,958 --> 01:32:04,309
You have to decide that yourself  my goal is to give you the tools 

1387
01:32:04,658 --> 01:32:06,379
to be able to ask the question  

1388
01:32:07,947 --> 01:32:11,611
I doubt seriously you are gonna answer the question even for yourself

1389
01:32:11,950 --> 01:32:16,539
You would probably come away feeling as uncomfortable about it

1390
01:32:16,893 --> 01:32:18,659
But you will know why you are uncomfortable 

1391
01:32:19,004 --> 01:32:21,435
You know what is it with some precision 

1392
01:32:21,784 --> 01:32:23,196
that's making you uncomfortable about it

1393
01:32:23,506 --> 01:32:24,967
At least I hope  at least that's my goal

1394
01:32:26,692 --> 01:32:27,460
Alright

1395
01:32:28,643 --> 01:32:32,429
>> In the equation you dealt there with the eye

1396
01:32:32,829 --> 01:32:36,209
>> forget about Schrodinger  just the eye

1397
01:32:36,629 --> 01:32:40,909
>> the equation that you wrote implies there is a correlation 

1398
01:32:41,259 --> 01:32:44,909
>> of one commutative state of system the apparatus 

1399
01:32:45,619 --> 01:32:48,909
>> could (inaudible)  and the state of the eye

1400
01:32:49,349 --> 01:32:54,289
Ya so the eye has become entangled with the rest of the system

1401
01:32:54,629 --> 01:32:57,119
>> So it was as though your vision weren't so good

1402
01:32:57,459 --> 01:33:00,039
(laughing) that's what you call a weak measurement 

1403
01:33:02,269 --> 01:33:06,189
Ya  look  that can happen that could be partial

1404
01:33:06,629 --> 01:33:08,349
It can be partial entanglement for sure 

1405
01:33:08,729 --> 01:33:12,199
I've given you a kind of idealized situation  alright

1406
01:33:12,529 --> 01:33:17,869
No it's a serious question  people talk about it

1407
01:33:18,219 --> 01:33:20,619
>> So I'm not quite sure with what the eye was saying?

1408
01:33:20,969 --> 01:33:26,039
No no  okay  there could be several reasons why your eye was not good

1409
01:33:26,399 --> 01:33:27,329
First of all you could be  

1410
01:33:27,639 --> 01:33:29,429
that the interaction with the apparatus would be simply to weak

1411
01:33:29,789 --> 01:33:32,739
That there wasn't enough room for the interaction 

1412
01:33:33,079 --> 01:33:34,209
It wasn't that your eyes were bad  

1413
01:33:34,569 --> 01:33:36,749
it's just wasn't coupling between the two systems

1414
01:33:37,079 --> 01:33:39,579
And then you only get partial information 

1415
01:33:39,929 --> 01:33:44,099
Or it could be that your eye is bare because you have Cataract let's say

1416
01:33:44,439 --> 01:33:49,189
Alright in that case  the eye did a measurement  

1417
01:33:49,579 --> 01:33:54,719
it became entangled with the system completely 

1418
01:33:55,049 --> 01:34:00,909
it's just the connection between the stuff in you eye 

1419
01:34:01,239 --> 01:34:07,459
And your brain wasn't good enough to send the signal back to your brain 

1420
01:34:07,819 --> 01:34:14,029
So the correlation happen but it was a bit messy

1421
01:34:14,369 --> 01:34:17,308
>> Was that detector efficiency problem?

1422
01:34:17,670 --> 01:34:20,848
That  sometimes it's the detector efficiency problem

1423
01:34:21,159 --> 01:34:25,335
Sometimes it's the problem  well detector efficiency could have to do

1424
01:34:25,672 --> 01:34:27,868
with the strength of interaction with the system

1425
01:34:28,199 --> 01:34:31,010
Or it could just be it's too hard to get the signal out

1426
01:34:31,336 --> 01:34:33,379
So I'm not sure what detector efficiency really means?

1427
01:34:33,701 --> 01:34:35,517
But I could think of several things

1428
01:34:35,878 --> 01:34:38,055
One is the signal is there and imprint itself into the system

1429
01:34:38,449 --> 01:34:40,878
And you personally have a hard time getting it out 

1430
01:34:41,207 --> 01:34:44,254
the other is that the interaction was not strong enough 

1431
01:34:44,664 --> 01:34:48,169
to really establish a full entanglement between the systems

1432
01:34:48,536 --> 01:34:49,654
both can happen

1433
01:34:50,019 --> 01:34:52,796
>> Would they bother be watching adult movie(?) ?

1434
01:34:54,354 --> 01:34:58,376
>> Would they know the detector 

1435
01:34:58,732 --> 01:35:00,873
You can think of all sort of the variance on this

1436
01:35:05,170 --> 01:35:06,931
>> but let's say a bad detector and entanglement 

1437
01:35:07,270 --> 01:35:10,123
>> and then I have a perfectly detector later on would it ...

1438
01:35:12,018 --> 01:35:16,344
I think  I guess the weakest link is where you 

1439
01:35:19,384 --> 01:35:21,128
Alright let's talk about locality

1440
01:35:21,448 --> 01:35:24,248
Let's talk about locality and entanglement

1441
01:35:24,599 --> 01:35:27,424
which is really where people got hung up

1442
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:31,296
And the villain  the arch villain here

1443
01:35:33,074 --> 01:35:41,802
who really tangle things badly was Einstein

1444
01:35:43,450 --> 01:35:46,216
Einstein not that he asked the question of course 

1445
01:35:46,577 --> 01:35:49,066
he asked a wonderful question about the entangled systems

1446
01:35:49,397 --> 01:35:51,996
Really are understanding the entanglement 

1447
01:35:52,387 --> 01:35:55,815
Then much of what we think about it and curious about it 

1448
01:35:56,121 --> 01:35:59,551
goes back to Einstein's question 1933

1449
01:36:01,136 --> 01:36:05,686
who was very much puzzled by the idea that you can have a system 

1450
01:36:06,036 --> 01:36:07,035
about which you know everything

1451
01:36:07,366 --> 01:36:09,123
and yet you know nothing about the components of it

1452
01:36:10,282 --> 01:36:14,643
and he wrote a paper  simply complaining about it

1453
01:36:15,016 --> 01:36:17,355
I don't know if he was the first one

1454
01:36:17,695 --> 01:36:19,906
to notice the phenomena of entanglement

1455
01:36:20,211 --> 01:36:25,595
I have a feeling not  he was the first one to get really exercised by it

1456
01:36:25,946 --> 01:36:28,186
and say something is very peculiar here

1457
01:36:28,531 --> 01:36:34,059
That I find quite okay  he then use the term 

1458
01:36:34,395 --> 01:36:39,986
What was the term again? Spooky action out of distance 

1459
01:36:40,314 --> 01:36:44,477
And that got everybody confused afterwards

1460
01:36:44,818 --> 01:36:49,528
Because Einstein knew exactly what action out of distance meant

1461
01:36:49,858 --> 01:36:56,444
And it didn't mean what he meant when he is using it in this context 

1462
01:36:56,780 --> 01:37:00,499
Action out of distance literally means forces

1463
01:37:00,830 --> 01:37:02,955
between systems at a distance

1464
01:37:03,299 --> 01:37:07,932
The ability to affect the outcome of a experiment at one place 

1465
01:37:08,262 --> 01:37:11,610
by doing something at another place 

1466
01:37:11,945 --> 01:37:16,028
Action out of distance  the columb(?) force between electrons

1467
01:37:16,370 --> 01:37:20,028
Now of course in the real world it's not action out of distance 

1468
01:37:20,372 --> 01:37:24,209
But in Newton's word  well Newton didn't know about electrons

1469
01:37:24,561 --> 01:37:26,177
Newton knew about gravity

1470
01:37:26,609 --> 01:37:27,585
In Newton's world

1471
01:37:28,015 --> 01:37:30,553
the gravitational interaction was action out of distance 

1472
01:37:30,914 --> 01:37:34,596
And the meaning of that from our point of view is

1473
01:37:35,008 --> 01:37:40,792
Something came along and gave the sun a sudden shove  

1474
01:37:41,130 --> 01:37:45,547
we would know it instantly for the simple reason that 

1475
01:37:45,906 --> 01:37:49,439
the orbit of the earth would instantly react

1476
01:37:49,844 --> 01:37:52,289
to the change in the position of the sun

1477
01:37:52,598 --> 01:37:54,251
The force on the earth will instantly react

1478
01:37:54,587 --> 01:37:59,366
And so every measurement of everything you might want to measure

1479
01:37:59,709 --> 01:38:06,472
Would be to some extent to another modified by the sudden change 

1480
01:38:06,817 --> 01:38:08,481
in the orbit of the sun

1481
01:38:08,829 --> 01:38:10,518
That's what action out of distance meant 

1482
01:38:10,886 --> 01:38:14,127
The ability if you like  to send the signal

1483
01:38:14,456 --> 01:38:17,003
By shoving the sun you are sending the signal to earth

1484
01:38:17,346 --> 01:38:18,715
And you are sending it instantaneously

1485
01:38:19,077 --> 01:38:20,259
if there is an action out of distance

1486
01:38:22,497 --> 01:38:26,828
Einstein must have known  I am certain that he knew that

1487
01:38:27,161 --> 01:38:31,800
Entanglement did not entail action out of distance in that sense

1488
01:38:33,583 --> 01:38:40,382
What one can do  what one can work out is supposing you start

1489
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:43,585
I will give you something you can try to play with

1490
01:38:43,941 --> 01:38:45,251
And see if you can work it out

1491
01:38:45,605 --> 01:38:48,704
Supposing you start with a system which is a two part system 

1492
01:38:49,269 --> 01:38:51,808
It has as wave function Psi of a and b

1493
01:38:52,163 --> 01:38:56,948
And from that system you can construct a density...

1494
01:38:57,244 --> 01:39:02,431
It's Alice and Bob  you can construct a density matrix with Rho for Alice

1495
01:39:03,875 --> 01:39:07,714
That density matrix contains every possible 

1496
01:39:08,066 --> 01:39:16,663
Oh statistical prediction that Alice can every make for her sub system a

1497
01:39:17,010 --> 01:39:21,798
Now let's imagine that Alice and Bob took their subsystems

1498
01:39:22,153 --> 01:39:27,833
Alice went to a distant planet  Bob stay in Palo Alto

1499
01:39:28,189 --> 01:39:31,090
And they are very far from one another 

1500
01:39:31,451 --> 01:39:35,085
So far that would take light four years to get from one place to another 

1501
01:39:36,517 --> 01:39:40,862
Bob does an experiment  that's means now 

1502
01:39:41,189 --> 01:39:43,998
This is an  this could be an entangled state 

1503
01:39:44,351 --> 01:39:45,782
This is not a non-entangled state

1504
01:39:46,105 --> 01:39:48,631
Bob does an experiment

1505
01:39:48,953 --> 01:39:53,720
and that has an effect on his half of the system here

1506
01:39:54,039 --> 01:39:58,352
But it has no effect whatever on Alice's density matrix

1507
01:39:58,704 --> 01:40:00,832
Perhaps I can prove that  I'm not gonna prove that tonight 

1508
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:10,258
It's not too hard to prove that any physically allowable change 

1509
01:40:10,575 --> 01:40:14,333
in this wave function which only involves Bob's half of it

1510
01:40:14,668 --> 01:40:19,043
The process of interacting with some other system or whatever it is

1511
01:40:19,394 --> 01:40:21,683
Bob gives it an electron or not  whatever he does to it 

1512
01:40:22,029 --> 01:40:26,927
He will not have any effect on Alice's density matrix 

1513
01:40:27,204 --> 01:40:30,170
That's the way quantum mechanics really put together 

1514
01:40:30,530 --> 01:40:36,191
And the implication is that anything that Bob does suddenly  

1515
01:40:36,538 --> 01:40:42,368
at a fixed instance of time  will not have any effect on any prediction 

1516
01:40:42,712 --> 01:40:44,719
or the success of any prediction  

1517
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:49,477
would have not effect on the statistical probabilities of Alice 

1518
01:40:49,820 --> 01:40:52,565
measuring anything about a  it just will not

1519
01:40:56,657 --> 01:40:59,293
So in that sense  it was impossible

1520
01:40:59,664 --> 01:41:03,045
for Bob to send the message to Alice suddenly

1521
01:41:03,380 --> 01:41:06,230
Now of course he can do an experiment on his sub system 

1522
01:41:07,837 --> 01:41:09,690
And after he has done the experiment 

1523
01:41:10,037 --> 01:41:12,600
he can then send the telegraph to Alice far away  

1524
01:41:12,927 --> 01:41:15,573
in a standard way that you send messages  

1525
01:41:15,937 --> 01:41:17,941
and tell her what the result again

1526
01:41:18,316 --> 01:41:24,689
This is an entangled state  it could be |up down> minus |down up>

1527
01:41:27,569 --> 01:41:32,384
When Bob does an measurement on his spin 

1528
01:41:32,709 --> 01:41:35,176
it has not effect on Alice's density matrix 

1529
01:41:35,526 --> 01:41:39,500
He can then send Alice a message and then say look I saw it down

1530
01:41:39,834 --> 01:41:43,576
And Alice will say ah  ya  that's because I saw up

1531
01:41:43,921 --> 01:41:47,048
It will correlate it  I thought they will correlated

1532
01:41:47,384 --> 01:41:48,639
and you just confirm that

1533
01:41:48,972 --> 01:41:52,311
I measure it up  but a few months ago 

1534
01:41:52,637 --> 01:41:54,592
and in fact I'm now getting you a telegram

1535
01:41:54,935 --> 01:41:59,466
And it tells me that you got down and that's consistent

1536
01:41:59,810 --> 01:42:00,992
everything was fine

1537
01:42:01,352 --> 01:42:03,400
Nobody sends any message faster than the speed of light 

1538
01:42:03,735 --> 01:42:10,494
The mere fact that when  Bob measure his variable

1539
01:42:10,820 --> 01:42:13,238
He instantly know something about Alice

1540
01:42:13,611 --> 01:42:17,869
It's no source of anxiety for locality

1541
01:42:18,208 --> 01:42:24,594
This would happen for nickels and dimes for a perfectly classical system 

1542
01:42:24,915 --> 01:42:28,010
The peculiarity is different than that  

1543
01:42:28,335 --> 01:42:30,378
the peculiarity has to do with this idea that 

1544
01:42:30,694 --> 01:42:33,258
you can know anything about a system and yet know nothing about it's parts

1545
01:42:33,564 --> 01:42:40,765
What is it then if this locality 

1546
01:42:41,106 --> 01:42:44,173
the standard physicist definition of locality is not at risk

1547
01:42:44,533 --> 01:42:50,130
And you can't send signal faster... what is it that Einstein meant

1548
01:42:50,471 --> 01:42:52,147
And what did Bell meant  

1549
01:42:52,518 --> 01:42:54,754
and what did all the other people who talk about these thing mean 

1550
01:42:55,074 --> 01:43:01,893
when they said entanglement entails a degree of non-locality

1551
01:43:02,228 --> 01:43:05,357
So I will try to explain to you by imagining a game 

1552
01:43:07,029 --> 01:43:11,376
>>Question? If Bob makes a measurement and Alice did not 

1553
01:43:11,714 --> 01:43:15,313
>>Can Bob send Alice a message after his measurement?

1554
01:43:15,656 --> 01:43:20,952
>> Will that information along be enough to change Alice's density matrix

1555
01:43:21,286 --> 01:43:22,584
To be enough for what?

1556
01:43:22,892 --> 01:43:24,881
>>to change Alice's density matrix

1557
01:43:25,222 --> 01:43:29,176
Oh yeah  if Alice sends  if Bob sends a real message

1558
01:43:29,506 --> 01:43:31,040
and Alice hasn't look yet

1559
01:43:31,371 --> 01:43:37,964
Okay so let's say  Alice has not look  she doesn't know anything yet 

1560
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:42,092
And as far as she is concerns the density matrix is consistent to that

1561
01:43:42,485 --> 01:43:44,164
And basically tells her nothing  

1562
01:43:44,539 --> 01:43:45,676
that's the density matrix which 

1563
01:43:46,009 --> 01:43:47,740
doesn't got very much information in it about her spin

1564
01:43:48,074 --> 01:43:52,733
And then she gets a telegram from Bob  saying my spin was up

1565
01:43:53,098 --> 01:43:57,794
As far as Alice's concern  that collapses her density matrix and tells her

1566
01:43:58,129 --> 01:44:00,857
her spin is down  so there after  

1567
01:44:01,202 --> 01:44:04,839
she still will use the density matrix which says her spin is down

1568
01:44:05,140 --> 01:44:09,302
So yes  once a message has time to go between them

1569
01:44:09,641 --> 01:44:13,094
Yes then she will know something she didn't know before 

1570
01:44:14,646 --> 01:44:18,947
And she will therefore update her density matrix 

1571
01:44:19,302 --> 01:44:22,319
But that would only take place after 

1572
01:44:22,640 --> 01:44:26,864
there's been insufficient time to for the signal to propagate

1573
01:44:28,767 --> 01:44:33,361
>> If I understand correctly  the statement we are making here

1574
01:44:33,766 --> 01:44:38,301
>> is about the expected value of these experiments right?

1575
01:44:38,611 --> 01:44:40,551
>> When you realize it once 

1576
01:44:40,867 --> 01:44:43,923
>> you are not actually getting the expected value  but you are gonna get

1577
01:44:44,283 --> 01:44:48,487
>> but this also holds for every value not just the expected values right?

1578
01:44:50,689 --> 01:44:54,425
No  expected or expectation value or whatever you want to call them  

1579
01:44:54,781 --> 01:44:59,283
average values  if you know the average values of all variables

1580
01:44:59,643 --> 01:45:01,076
You don't need to know  let's okay

1581
01:45:01,441 --> 01:45:04,600
Supposing we have one variable that we are interested in 

1582
01:45:04,929 --> 01:45:10,103
Let's call it L again  if we know the average value of L

1583
01:45:11,295 --> 01:45:15,820
The average value of L square  the average value of L cubed 

1584
01:45:16,173 --> 01:45:19,821
Dot dot dot  we know the whole probability distribution of L

1585
01:45:20,140 --> 01:45:22,757
This is called knowing the moments  

1586
01:45:23,085 --> 01:45:25,166
all of the moments of a probability distribution

1587
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:28,694
If we know all the expectation values of L  L squared L cubed

1588
01:45:31,575 --> 01:45:34,615
Actually for a single spin  you only need the spin and the spin's square 

1589
01:45:34,976 --> 01:45:39,144
Then you know the full probability distribution 

1590
01:45:39,512 --> 01:45:41,560
Once you know the full probability distribution that's all you can know 

1591
01:45:43,328 --> 01:45:49,747
So knowing all  knowing a full set of expectation values like this

1592
01:45:50,084 --> 01:45:52,643
is knowing everything I was to know about the system 

1593
01:45:54,651 --> 01:45:58,521
>> but the actual realization of the experiment that happens towards it

1594
01:45:58,894 --> 01:46:00,149
Oh that's right  yeah  that's right

1595
01:46:01,482 --> 01:46:03,249
>> they are still guaranteed to be opposite right?

1596
01:46:09,561 --> 01:46:10,601
They are guaranteed to be opposite  yes

1597
01:46:10,936 --> 01:46:15,857
But Alice doesn't update her information about  until she gets 

1598
01:46:16,094 --> 01:46:20,030
Before Alice get the information  as far as she knows it's half a half

1599
01:46:20,382 --> 01:46:22,128
But let's try to do a little bit better 

1600
01:46:22,614 --> 01:46:28,574
Alice and Bob are now going to each have many spins  alright

1601
01:46:28,940 --> 01:46:33,125
So Charlie is gonna give each of them many entangled pairs

1602
01:46:35,506 --> 01:46:41,551
So Alice has spin number one  and Bob has his spin number one

1603
01:46:41,900 --> 01:46:45,717
And they are in the relationship of being entangled 

1604
01:46:47,957 --> 01:46:52,021
Also Alice has spin number two which is not entangled with spin number one

1605
01:46:52,323 --> 01:46:56,068
But it happens to be entangled with Bob's spin number two

1606
01:46:57,180 --> 01:47:00,404
Charlie gave them a whole series of these 

1607
01:47:06,940 --> 01:47:10,460
So they can do statistical experiment and collect statistics

1608
01:47:15,885 --> 01:47:19,596
When they've collected statistics they will discover that 

1609
01:47:19,940 --> 01:47:22,517
every time Bob is up Alice is down

1610
01:47:22,853 --> 01:47:25,066
Every time Bob is down Alice up

1611
01:47:25,391 --> 01:47:27,124
But they can do a lot more than that 

1612
01:47:27,473 --> 01:47:31,696
They can  let's see what's a good example for what can be done

1613
01:47:36,091 --> 01:47:41,717
Ya right  good  Bob does all of his experiments here

1614
01:47:42,084 --> 01:47:43,283
at some instance of time

1615
01:47:43,633 --> 01:47:45,241
And finds out every one of these  

1616
01:47:45,567 --> 01:47:47,625
finds out exactly what everyone of them is doing 

1617
01:47:47,977 --> 01:47:52,779
Does that convey any information at all to Alice about 

1618
01:47:53,117 --> 01:47:56,503
which she knows that just about half of them are up

1619
01:47:56,813 --> 01:47:57,823
and half of them are down

1620
01:47:59,015 --> 01:48:00,951
Bob goes in mixed measurement  

1621
01:48:01,292 --> 01:48:03,767
he does his measurement on every single one of them

1622
01:48:04,094 --> 01:48:09,470
Does Alice know anything afterward that she didn't know before? No

1623
01:48:09,816 --> 01:48:13,911
Does anything surprising happen when she measures these things? 

1624
01:48:14,068 --> 01:48:18,023
Does the statistic of these thing over here in any way change 

1625
01:48:18,359 --> 01:48:21,030
because Bob measure this things?

1626
01:48:21,382 --> 01:48:23,063
No  there will be no statistical difference

1627
01:48:23,441 --> 01:48:25,139
Bob can do his measurement

1628
01:48:26,427 --> 01:48:28,446
throw his measurement in the waste paper basket 

1629
01:48:28,768 --> 01:48:30,759
But he's measured every single one of these 

1630
01:48:31,127 --> 01:48:34,765
He has no influence at all on what Alice measures 

1631
01:48:35,097 --> 01:48:41,249
But if Bob sends a message to Alice before she does her measurement 

1632
01:48:41,621 --> 01:48:46,124
And says spin one came out plus  spin two came out minus bla bla bla

1633
01:48:46,498 --> 01:48:49,550
Then instantly Alice knows everything about these

1634
01:48:49,875 --> 01:48:54,028
In fact he could say sigma z equals plus one 

1635
01:48:54,375 --> 01:48:57,334
But he decided over here not to measure sigma z 

1636
01:48:57,665 --> 01:48:59,988
So I'm gonna measure sigma x over here  minus one 

1637
01:49:00,331 --> 01:49:03,394
And over here he measure sigma y equals plus one 

1638
01:49:04,968 --> 01:49:10,690
Having made these measurements without informing Alice in any way

1639
01:49:11,074 --> 01:49:14,138
Does nothing whatever to the statistic of her measurement 

1640
01:49:14,444 --> 01:49:20,574
But if he now senses them  she can now decide

1641
01:49:20,938 --> 01:49:22,935
She can decide to measure anything she wants 

1642
01:49:23,262 --> 01:49:24,775
But if she decides to measure sigma z 

1643
01:49:25,106 --> 01:49:29,688
because she knew that Bob got plus one here and sigma x for this one

1644
01:49:30,021 --> 01:49:31,280
And sigma y for this one

1645
01:49:31,629 --> 01:49:35,390
we will find that in every case that they are opposite

1646
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:39,743
>> Are you saying that Bob send the message  I'm not sure I understand

1647
01:49:40,055 --> 01:49:41,063
Yes it's a telegram 

1648
01:49:41,392 --> 01:49:43,504
>> there is not he sending that is receiving at the (inaudible)

1649
01:49:43,842 --> 01:49:45,039
well of course yes 

1650
01:49:45,378 --> 01:49:45,967
>> How can you be sure?

1651
01:49:46,384 --> 01:49:49,231
Well the important point is that it takes time to send the message 

1652
01:49:53,751 --> 01:49:59,227
What? I missed  okay  well yes that was a problem 

1653
01:50:01,256 --> 01:50:06,306
>> I don't know...it seems like the feeling of spooky action distances

1654
01:50:06,644 --> 01:50:08,825
>>comes not from ... 

1655
01:50:10,360 --> 01:50:13,265
>> But it's also sticky about the inside the spectator (?)

1656
01:50:13,624 --> 01:50:15,233
>>there is two sepralities

1657
01:50:15,567 --> 01:50:20,350
Well  I will try to give you a precise definition 

1658
01:50:22,726 --> 01:50:28,302
There is a theorem looking here  I don't know that the theorem has ever 

1659
01:50:28,666 --> 01:50:31,817
been discussed in the computer science community

1660
01:50:32,144 --> 01:50:34,540
It's kind of a computer science theorem 

1661
01:50:36,054 --> 01:50:38,847
whether anybody has actually discussed it 

1662
01:50:39,172 --> 01:50:40,930
in a language I'm gonna tell you now I don't know

1663
01:50:41,309 --> 01:50:43,852
And I don't really quite know how to formulate it

1664
01:50:44,178 --> 01:50:45,773
as a theorem I've never tried

1665
01:50:47,871 --> 01:50:52,767
But I think I can capture the essence of what this theorem would say

1666
01:50:53,096 --> 01:50:55,635
If only the theorem could be made precise 

1667
01:50:57,912 --> 01:50:59,517
We have ten minutes to try to do this 

1668
01:50:59,914 --> 01:51:02,487
We go over it a little bit  we will do that 

1669
01:51:05,457 --> 01:51:06,789
Here is a game I wanna play 

1670
01:51:07,162 --> 01:51:12,380
I want  I'm gonna write a computer program  my computer 

1671
01:51:12,706 --> 01:51:15,421
My computer has a screen  okay it has a screen 

1672
01:51:15,784 --> 01:51:18,189
and all the usual thing that a computer have

1673
01:51:18,510 --> 01:51:21,053
Over here on the screen there is a little blackbox 

1674
01:51:21,377 --> 01:51:25,909
And that little blackbox is called spin  you can't see inside it

1675
01:51:26,271 --> 01:51:27,429
But there is something in it 

1676
01:51:27,770 --> 01:51:33,912
And in here is apparatus A  an apparatus A 

1677
01:51:34,236 --> 01:51:36,346
you can see what it's doing and so forth

1678
01:51:37,714 --> 01:51:39,865
It's got a zero  I can measure zero or one

1679
01:51:40,189 --> 01:51:45,047
Now here's the game  the memory stores two things

1680
01:51:45,368 --> 01:51:48,882
The memory store information about the spin 

1681
01:51:49,258 --> 01:51:51,469
This is a completely classical computer 

1682
01:51:51,786 --> 01:51:55,658
The game we are gonna play is I'm gonna fool you into thinking 

1683
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,033
it's really a quantum mechanics system in here

1684
01:51:59,495 --> 01:52:00,185
How are we gonna do that?

1685
01:52:00,524 --> 01:52:04,129
We are gonna do it by I'm going to write a computer program 

1686
01:52:04,466 --> 01:52:08,147
which completely simulates  the classical computer program

1687
01:52:08,510 --> 01:52:13,827
It completely simulates what happens when the apparatus look at a spin

1688
01:52:14,149 --> 01:52:16,235
Okay so here's the way it's gonna go 

1689
01:52:18,656 --> 01:52:21,019
We are going to start just for convenience 

1690
01:52:21,337 --> 01:52:23,819
We will start with the spin in a known state

1691
01:52:25,139 --> 01:52:30,750
So the apparatus or the computer program  it's not important 

1692
01:52:31,103 --> 01:52:34,121
But the computer program let's say its starts out with a spin up 

1693
01:52:34,436 --> 01:52:35,795
or whatever it's doing

1694
01:52:37,385 --> 01:52:42,123
The apparatus can either reads zero or one 

1695
01:52:42,447 --> 01:52:45,563
There is a button over here in this

1696
01:52:45,926 --> 01:52:48,107
There is a button over here that you touch

1697
01:52:48,451 --> 01:52:53,119
And that button is M  means you measure  means measurement 

1698
01:52:53,506 --> 01:52:55,623
So when you touch that button over here 

1699
01:52:55,951 --> 01:52:57,767
The apparatus measures the spin 

1700
01:52:58,071 --> 01:53:01,748
The computer records two things

1701
01:53:02,068 --> 01:53:06,561
It records the state vector of the spin  how does it do that?

1702
01:53:06,898 --> 01:53:09,269
By providing two complex numbers  

1703
01:53:09,587 --> 01:53:14,466
stored into computers are two complex numbers alpha up and alpha down 

1704
01:53:14,816 --> 01:53:19,229
Subject to the constraint that alpha star alpha plus alpha star alpha

1705
01:53:19,514 --> 01:53:20,558
is equal to one

1706
01:53:20,915 --> 01:53:23,038
So it stores in information

1707
01:53:23,370 --> 01:53:26,286
which is equivalent to the state vector of the spin

1708
01:53:26,596 --> 01:53:29,350
And the other thing it stores is the direction

1709
01:53:29,690 --> 01:53:31,534
that you point the apparatus

1710
01:53:31,896 --> 01:53:35,478
You can move the apparatus around by playing with the computer

1711
01:53:35,839 --> 01:53:39,246
Not moving it around but you can reorient it in any directions

1712
01:53:39,581 --> 01:53:40,526
that you like

1713
01:53:40,901 --> 01:53:42,822
You start with a spin up

1714
01:53:43,141 --> 01:53:46,144
now this spin might be interacting with a magnetic field

1715
01:53:46,474 --> 01:53:48,030
Or whatever it's happening to it

1716
01:53:48,370 --> 01:53:50,950
The computer solves the Schrodinger equation 

1717
01:53:51,283 --> 01:53:53,870
In solving the Schrodinger equation for the spin

1718
01:53:54,193 --> 01:53:57,014
that means it updates the state of the spin

1719
01:53:57,349 --> 01:54:00,430
you start with a particular state  but it's now what it is

1720
01:54:00,807 --> 01:54:05,030
And after a time to it  it update the spin  it updates the state

1721
01:54:05,368 --> 01:54:10,152
So the computer now know what alpha is after a certain time is elapsed 

1722
01:54:10,474 --> 01:54:18,231
Then you punch the measure button and the computer takes the state

1723
01:54:18,571 --> 01:54:21,054
turns it into a pair of probabilities

1724
01:54:21,408 --> 01:54:24,310
alpha star alpha up  alpha star alpha down

1725
01:54:24,643 --> 01:54:28,365
The computer now knows that the probability for up and down

1726
01:54:28,714 --> 01:54:31,549
And it also has a random number generator 

1727
01:54:31,896 --> 01:54:35,533
Random number generator or a dime doesn't and they work very well 

1728
01:54:35,882 --> 01:54:37,819
with the random number generator 

1729
01:54:38,154 --> 01:54:41,469
it then take the probability alpha up and alpha down

1730
01:54:41,828 --> 01:54:44,189
And spit out the number plus or minus one 

1731
01:54:44,529 --> 01:54:50,116
with probability alpha star alpha and alpha star alpha

1732
01:54:50,435 --> 01:54:52,788
So we just simulate the quantum mechanics 

1733
01:54:53,156 --> 01:54:54,834
by having a random number generator

1734
01:54:55,177 --> 01:55:00,158
That either spits out plus one or minus one  

1735
01:55:00,481 --> 01:55:03,725
but with a probability that's given by alpha star alpha 

1736
01:55:04,078 --> 01:55:08,353
But then the computer then whatever the answer is 

1737
01:55:08,748 --> 01:55:11,536
Whatever the answer that the apparatus spit out

1738
01:55:11,873 --> 01:55:16,059
The computer then updates once again the state of the spin 

1739
01:55:16,372 --> 01:55:21,422
And says it is in the state that the apparatus measure 

1740
01:55:21,742 --> 01:55:25,847
So if the apparatus spits out plus one along some axis 

1741
01:55:26,180 --> 01:55:28,867
You get to turn the apparatus

1742
01:55:29,195 --> 01:55:35,239
but of course if you get to turn the apparatus

1743
01:55:35,575 --> 01:55:37,455
you have to do a slightly complicated calculation 

1744
01:55:37,777 --> 01:55:40,292
to find out what this statistics are  

1745
01:55:40,636 --> 01:55:43,587
but once you've done it  whatever the answer is

1746
01:55:43,906 --> 01:55:48,668
The computer goes back and update the state of the spin 

1747
01:55:49,019 --> 01:55:51,723
to make it consistent with what the apparatus measure

1748
01:55:52,073 --> 01:55:53,974
You can do this  you can try to write a program 

1749
01:55:54,334 --> 01:55:56,579
and it's a program that could be written

1750
01:55:56,898 --> 01:55:58,571
It's probably not even terribly complicated 

1751
01:55:58,910 --> 01:56:05,586
And if you  only got to look at the measuring button  decide to measure

1752
01:56:05,939 --> 01:56:09,979
And look at the outcome  you would get everything exactly equivalent 

1753
01:56:10,302 --> 01:56:12,517
to the extent of a random number generator  

1754
01:56:12,867 --> 01:56:14,874
can be a good faithful random number generator

1755
01:56:15,210 --> 01:56:18,442
You will completely simulate the quantum mechanics of the system 

1756
01:56:20,148 --> 01:56:22,803
What this is that quantum mechanics system 

1757
01:56:23,129 --> 01:56:25,386
can be a special case of classical physics

1758
01:56:25,702 --> 01:56:26,690
So what's going on? 

1759
01:56:27,042 --> 01:56:28,450
What the quantum mechanics system

1760
01:56:28,877 --> 01:56:30,106
can be a special case of classical mechanics

1761
01:56:30,426 --> 01:56:34,877
what is all this confusion about quantum mechanics spin?

1762
01:56:35,241 --> 01:56:38,301
Logically different  alright

1763
01:56:38,695 --> 01:56:43,002
Now we want to play the same game with a pair of spins

1764
01:56:43,333 --> 01:56:49,858
>>quantum mechanics is a special case of a classical mechanics

1765
01:56:50,192 --> 01:56:52,058
>> but in the former class  everything was deterministic 

1766
01:56:52,391 --> 01:56:53,768
>> and then introducing probability

1767
01:56:55,483 --> 01:56:56,250
Okay but it's only  yay a  

1768
01:56:56,576 --> 01:57:00,747
it's a classical computer and it's using a classical number generator 

1769
01:57:01,123 --> 01:57:03,522
A classical random number generator alright?

1770
01:57:03,876 --> 01:57:07,754
So you don't have to add in another  but the difference between 

1771
01:57:08,134 --> 01:57:10,450
quantum mechanics and classical mechanics isn't randomness

1772
01:57:10,784 --> 01:57:12,987
You can generate all sorts of random number generators 

1773
01:57:13,322 --> 01:57:16,747
that would easily fool you into thinking if they are really random

1774
01:57:17,122 --> 01:57:21,808
Cause any real random number generator  the numbers come from somewhere

1775
01:57:22,170 --> 01:57:23,736
So they are not strictly random 

1776
01:57:24,084 --> 01:57:27,624
But you can sure make a random number generator that would fool anybody

1777
01:57:29,104 --> 01:57:31,336
So ya  you can build  

1778
01:57:31,645 --> 01:57:36,479
you can build a computer program to simulates the quantum mechanics 

1779
01:57:36,766 --> 01:57:42,375
basically of any systems that you like by the same method  okay?

1780
01:57:42,712 --> 01:57:44,391
But now supposing you wanted to

1781
01:57:44,745 --> 01:57:47,935
simulate a system consisting of two electrons

1782
01:57:48,237 --> 01:57:50,255
There is two electrons two boxes here

1783
01:57:50,617 --> 01:57:52,944
And you wanted to do it with two computers 

1784
01:57:53,268 --> 01:57:58,406
And in the process of taking the electron apart from each other

1785
01:57:58,760 --> 01:58:02,581
So as to ask this question about  you want to take the computers 

1786
01:58:02,943 --> 01:58:08,433
You want to encode the information about Alice's spin in one computer 

1787
01:58:08,775 --> 01:58:13,683
And Bob's spin in other computer  physically separated them

1788
01:58:14,024 --> 01:58:19,229
And ask can these computers simulates quantum mechanics?

1789
01:58:19,592 --> 01:58:20,733
So I will tell you want the answer is

1790
01:58:21,094 --> 01:58:27,057
As long as the spin are in a product state 

1791
01:58:27,409 --> 01:58:29,393
As long as they start in a product state

1792
01:58:29,724 --> 01:58:31,136
and they don't interact with each other

1793
01:58:31,464 --> 01:58:32,968
And therefore stay in a product state 

1794
01:58:33,319 --> 01:58:34,745
Then you can do it  

1795
01:58:35,040 --> 01:58:39,962
then you can put all of the information about Bob's spin in here

1796
01:58:40,288 --> 01:58:42,915
Or all the information about Alice's spin in here

1797
01:58:43,300 --> 01:58:46,974
Likewise you can have Bob's apparatus over here

1798
01:58:47,336 --> 01:58:50,600
You can have Alice's apparatus over here  a little black box

1799
01:58:50,930 --> 01:58:56,737
And it's just basically two identical versions of what I said before 

1800
01:58:58,260 --> 01:59:00,857
You can take the computer physically separate them

1801
01:59:01,192 --> 01:59:05,547
Do experiments on each one and they would completely agree with

1802
01:59:05,910 --> 01:59:08,969
the result of quantum mechanics  because if they are in a product state 

1803
01:59:09,327 --> 01:59:12,344
One doesn't care about the other  but then you say 

1804
01:59:12,698 --> 01:59:16,037
what if I wanted to put these two spins in a entangled state 

1805
01:59:16,388 --> 01:59:20,935
Well first of all  to put them in a entangled state 

1806
01:59:21,274 --> 01:59:24,559
you can not do it without bringing the computers together

1807
01:59:24,903 --> 01:59:27,903
Bringing the computers together so that they talk to each other

1808
01:59:29,487 --> 01:59:34,320
You can record in the combined computer system now they brought together

1809
01:59:34,672 --> 01:59:46,032
How many numbers does it take to specify the state of two spin system? Six

1810
01:59:47,512 --> 01:59:50,451
So you record six numbers in the computer here 

1811
01:59:52,300 --> 01:59:54,685
Six numbers are recorded in the computer 

1812
01:59:55,004 --> 02:00:04,319
And some numbers to reflect the orientations of various apparatuses 

1813
02:00:04,717 --> 02:00:05,822
that you might conceive of 

1814
02:00:06,173 --> 02:00:08,790
And then you try to split the computer in two

1815
02:00:09,078 --> 02:00:15,615
Keeping Alice's information in here and Bob's information in here

1816
02:00:15,940 --> 02:00:18,558
separate them and try to simulate 

1817
02:00:18,938 --> 02:00:23,078
the quantum mechanics of the entangled system

1818
02:00:23,404 --> 02:00:27,172
Bell's theorem is what tell you that you can not do this 

1819
02:00:27,515 --> 02:00:34,998
unless there are instantaneous action out of distance phenomena 

1820
02:00:35,329 --> 02:00:38,145
taking place between the... wires between the computers so to speak

1821
02:00:38,486 --> 02:00:41,102
Hidden wires that have to be part of the system 

1822
02:00:41,453 --> 02:00:43,510
connecting the computers together 

1823
02:00:43,836 --> 02:00:50,434
you cannot simulate the quantum mechanics with a classical computer system

1824
02:00:50,764 --> 02:00:55,287
You can't simulates the quantum mechanics of an entangled system 

1825
02:00:55,648 --> 02:01:01,972
Unless it's really just one computer  really one computer means 

1826
02:01:02,307 --> 02:01:05,525
That signal can be transmitted back and forth basically instantly 

1827
02:01:05,850 --> 02:01:08,544
That's what Bell's theorem really says

1828
02:01:08,901 --> 02:01:12,629
Now is this a form of non-locality?

1829
02:01:12,981 --> 02:01:18,297
Well you might think that if you really have to have these wires there

1830
02:01:19,827 --> 02:01:21,151
To simulate quantum mechanics 

1831
02:01:21,535 --> 02:01:24,671
Then why can't you send the instantaneous message through these wires?

1832
02:01:25,008 --> 02:01:29,710
Of course you can,  but not if you only allow yourself 

1833
02:01:30,043 --> 02:01:32,993
to do the thing which quantum mechanics permits

1834
02:01:33,330 --> 02:01:35,694
For example there are things that quantum mechanics doesn't permit

1835
02:01:36,051 --> 02:01:37,071
It doesn't allow you 

1836
02:01:37,429 --> 02:01:39,569
to measure the x and y component of the spin simultaneously

1837
02:01:41,202 --> 02:01:44,099
All kinds of thing that does not permit you to do

1838
02:01:44,467 --> 02:01:47,294
Because they correspond to non-commutating operators

1839
02:01:47,668 --> 02:01:51,394
But if you restrict yourself to the measurement which quantum mechanics

1840
02:01:51,762 --> 02:01:55,283
allows you to do on either one of these  or any combination of them

1841
02:01:55,712 --> 02:01:58,241
Then it's a very magical and special fact 

1842
02:01:58,581 --> 02:02:02,361
That you can not send information faster than speed of light 

1843
02:02:02,681 --> 02:02:06,672
You can not send information instantaneously by this computer set up

1844
02:02:07,107 --> 02:02:11,515
>> What if you assign a probability but conditional probability

1845
02:02:11,833 --> 02:02:16,647
Doesn't matter  doesn't matter  if you want to simulate a quantum system 

1846
02:02:17,018 --> 02:02:19,361
with a classical system of computers 

1847
02:02:19,717 --> 02:02:22,363
And you want to study entangled systems 

1848
02:02:22,711 --> 02:02:24,805
That computers have to be able to

1849
02:02:25,181 --> 02:02:27,158
communicate with each other instantaneously

1850
02:02:27,488 --> 02:02:29,226
That's the content of Bell's theorem 

1851
02:02:29,580 --> 02:02:34,268
Now does that mean that there is any action  spooky action out of distance

1852
02:02:34,621 --> 02:02:37,990
Or does it just mean that you have gotten yourselves into trouble 

1853
02:02:38,275 --> 02:02:42,622
by trying to simulate quantum mechanics with classical mechanics

1854
02:02:42,974 --> 02:02:46,263
And my view is that you've gotten yourselves into trouble 

1855
02:02:46,629 --> 02:02:50,425
by trying to simulate something which just doesn't want to be 

1856
02:02:50,772 --> 02:02:52,697
describe by a classical computer systems

1857
02:02:53,010 --> 02:02:55,257
And it's a deep and interesting fact about quantum mechanics 

1858
02:02:55,606 --> 02:03:02,046
Einstein's view was that this is basically evidence 

1859
02:03:02,376 --> 02:03:05,609
that the description is incomplete

1860
02:03:05,946 --> 02:03:09,703
And there are other variables for the system

1861
02:03:10,055 --> 02:03:15,092
And Bell's conclusion was those variables have to be hidden wires 

1862
02:03:15,407 --> 02:03:16,963
that connect distant places

1863
02:03:18,339 --> 02:03:24,716
So you can take it for however you see it yourselves 

1864
02:03:25,128 --> 02:03:27,363
>> If you have a quantum computer there  

1865
02:03:27,690 --> 02:03:29,595
>> and let's say when you have the states

1866
02:03:29,962 --> 02:03:31,709
If you have a quantum computer you can do it

1867
02:03:31,998 --> 02:03:34,339
>> and you separated it right

1868
02:03:34,659 --> 02:03:37,036
>> now when you look at Bob's computer

1869
02:03:37,359 --> 02:03:39,301
>>you know something about Alice's right?

1870
02:03:39,658 --> 02:03:40,893
>> but can't really still send

1871
02:03:41,222 --> 02:03:44,276
It's the same problem  but look all the quantum computer 

1872
02:03:44,638 --> 02:03:47,444
It's an electron in this computer

1873
02:03:47,803 --> 02:03:49,623
and electron (in that computer) that is all it is

1874
02:03:49,976 --> 02:03:53,587
It's just a quantum system right  it's just a true quantum system

1875
02:03:53,963 --> 02:03:57,563
Quantum system  and each one of these which has just been entangled 

1876
02:03:57,891 --> 02:03:59,411
That's all what a quantum computer is 

1877
02:03:59,770 --> 02:04:00,931
It's a quantum mechanical system 

1878
02:04:01,257 --> 02:04:06,993
which can reflect the logical structure of quantum mechanics

1879
02:04:07,311 --> 02:04:08,337
And the way to make it  

1880
02:04:08,687 --> 02:04:12,241
is by actually making a pair of entangled electrons in there

1881
02:04:12,594 --> 02:04:15,002
Something real has to be entangled between them

1882
02:04:15,316 --> 02:04:20,471
And it can't be simulated by a fake computer program 

1883
02:04:20,812 --> 02:04:24,246
unless the computer has this property of 

1884
02:04:24,591 --> 02:04:27,255
>> (inaudible)

1885
02:04:27,561 --> 02:04:30,887
Sure  alright

1886
02:04:31,282 --> 02:04:36,856
>> You could sort of hack this problem away using an analogy

1887
02:04:37,209 --> 02:04:41,400
>> supre random number generators all synchronized 

1888
02:04:41,721 --> 02:04:45,511
>> so there are actually not they will be random 

1889
02:04:49,903 --> 02:04:54,605
What you can't do is synchronize them in advance 

1890
02:04:56,343 --> 02:04:59,484
and then not let them interact with each other 

1891
02:04:59,824 --> 02:05:03,386
That wont' do it  the random number have to be

1892
02:05:03,740 --> 02:05:06,986
The random number generator have to be such that what this one measures

1893
02:05:07,322 --> 02:05:09,258
respond to what that one measure

1894
02:05:09,599 --> 02:05:12,890
>> Like for example  what I meant was 

1895
02:05:14,506 --> 02:05:18,354
>> the random number generator are synchronized at the beginning 

1896
02:05:18,597 --> 02:05:22,604
>> and whenever you measure  because they are synchronized

1897
02:05:22,922 --> 02:05:26,986
>> they will always generate up and down reversed

1898
02:05:30,418 --> 02:05:33,994
No  it's simply not enough  this is what the theorem says

1899
02:05:34,325 --> 02:05:39,110
It is not enough to synchronize them in advance and then take them apart

1900
02:05:39,404 --> 02:05:41,822
They've got to continue to interact with each other 

1901
02:05:42,179 --> 02:05:45,990
That's what it says  that they must continue to interact with each other

1902
02:05:46,314 --> 02:05:47,810
and feed information back and forth

1903
02:05:54,892 --> 02:05:58,326
>> The problem was delay choice if you put a Bell 

1904

>> four light years away  and that (?)

1906
02:06:11,611 --> 02:06:12,909
I told you everything I know about it

1907
02:06:13,244 --> 02:06:16,836
And what I know about it is that there is nothing Bob could do

1908
02:06:17,190 --> 02:06:20,992
which can influence the statistics of Alice's measurements

1909
02:06:21,327 --> 02:06:24,358
without sending her a measure

1910
02:06:24,737 --> 02:06:28,243
>> (inaudible)

1911
02:06:33,485 --> 02:06:35,912
Alright two more questions 

1912
02:06:43,435 --> 02:06:47,866
>> you said we can classically simulate quantum mechanics?

1913
02:06:48,197 --> 02:06:51,796
Yes you can classically simulate quantum mechanics

1914
02:06:52,137 --> 02:06:55,842
But you basically have to do it with in a single computer

1915
02:06:56,175 --> 02:06:58,356
Where all parts of it speaks to every other parts

1916
02:06:58,727 --> 02:07:00,872
You can not physically take them apart 

1917
02:07:01,202 --> 02:07:03,562
the way you would want to take the quantum systems apart

1922
02:07:21,777 --> 02:07:27,008
No  no  In an entangled system Bob can do his measurement  

1923
02:07:27,335 --> 02:07:28,931
Alice can do her measurements

1924
02:07:29,256 --> 02:07:31,643
But there are other things that can be measured 

1925
02:07:31,977 --> 02:07:34,660
beside just the things that Alice would measure 

1926
02:07:34,997 --> 02:07:37,791
on her system or the thing Bob would measure

1927
02:07:38,151 --> 02:07:41,696
For example  neither Bob nor Alice by themselves

1928
02:07:42,116 --> 02:07:46,372
can measure sigma x times tau x

1929
02:07:46,721 --> 02:07:47,890
It takes both of them to do it

1930
02:07:48,240 --> 02:07:51,011
It takes both detectors  it takes both apparatuses 

1931
02:07:51,359 --> 02:07:54,277
to make a measurement of sigma x times tau x

1932
02:07:54,628 --> 02:07:56,957
This is something that you can not measure 

1933
02:07:57,306 --> 02:07:59,600
Now you can measure with two apparatuses 

1934
02:07:59,926 --> 02:08:02,341
The question is are there anything you could measure 

1935
02:08:02,637 --> 02:08:05,447
That you couldn't measure even with those two apparatuses

1936
02:08:05,772 --> 02:08:12,638
And yes there are  sigma x tau x plus sigma y tau y plus sigma z tau z

1937
02:08:12,982 --> 02:08:17,551
is something that can not even be measured by using both apparatuses 

1938
02:08:17,914 --> 02:08:21,642
It takes a new kind of apparatus which is not a combination 

1939
02:08:21,972 --> 02:08:24,355
of Alice's and Bob's original apparatuses 

1940
02:08:24,692 --> 02:08:28,324
Which each measures a Bob's thing and an Alice's thing

1941
02:08:29,955 --> 02:08:31,635
>> Can Bob measure the entanglement 

1942
02:08:33,188 --> 02:08:34,772
Nobody can measure entanglement 

1943
02:08:40,795 --> 02:08:48,478
No  Bob can discover that he's got  nobody can do anything with one event

1944
02:08:50,005 --> 02:08:52,413
But if you have a whole replication like I describe

1945
02:08:52,780 --> 02:08:54,365
where did I describe it?

1946
02:08:54,682 --> 02:08:56,760
Well we have many replica of the same thing 

1947
02:08:58,109 --> 02:08:59,845
Many replica of the same thing  

1948
02:09:00,212 --> 02:09:06,287
then Bob can discover the fact that his state is entangled with something 

1949
02:09:06,615 --> 02:09:08,271
And the way he does it

1950
02:09:08,577 --> 02:09:12,175
is he says let me search around for a direction in space

1951
02:09:12,492 --> 02:09:16,405
For which the spins are definitely align in some direction

1952
02:09:16,748 --> 02:09:17,404
Here is what he knows 

1953
02:09:17,732 --> 02:09:20,114
He knows that all the system were prepared in the same way

1954
02:09:21,513 --> 02:09:24,041
They are all identical  each pairs is identical... 

1955
02:09:24,371 --> 02:09:26,705
each pair is identical to each other pair

1956
02:09:27,084 --> 02:09:31,337
And he's wondering could each one of these be in a product state?

1957
02:09:31,812 --> 02:09:34,367
Same product state for this one  same product state for that one 

1958
02:09:34,675 --> 02:09:35,867
Same product state for that one 

1959
02:09:36,216 --> 02:09:39,524
If there have inner product state then Bob can search around

1960
02:09:39,833 --> 02:09:42,658
He's got enough version of it  enough trials 

1961
02:09:43,054 --> 02:09:45,531
that he can go on and on with experiments for ever 

1962
02:09:45,889 --> 02:09:49,712
And he could search around for a direction where 

1963
02:09:50,086 --> 02:09:52,046
when he measures the spin his spin

1964
02:09:52,373 --> 02:09:54,669
He always discover that it's up

1965
02:09:55,033 --> 02:09:59,042
Now the first time he maybe in the wrong direction 

1966
02:09:59,435 --> 02:10:00,537
And he will find down 

1967
02:10:00,903 --> 02:10:04,550
Next time he may find up and try again it would be down  wrong direction

1968
02:10:04,886 --> 02:10:08,110
It keeps searching around  if it's a product state

1969
02:10:08,473 --> 02:10:09,875
he would eventually find 

1970
02:10:10,232 --> 02:10:15,905
the direction where the spin would continue to be up up up up

1971
02:10:16,250 --> 02:10:17,066
after he's found it

1972
02:10:17,434 --> 02:10:20,560
If it's in an entangled state  no matter what directions he measures

1973
02:10:20,910 --> 02:10:24,088
He will always find the spin are random okay

1974
02:10:26,447 --> 02:10:28,136
That's the character of it

1975
02:10:31,504 --> 02:10:33,455
>> And that's a seperate measurement right?

1976
02:10:33,792 --> 02:10:35,664
>> on separate discrete measurement right?

1977
02:10:36,030 --> 02:10:37,248
>> If not the measurement are the same thing

1978
02:10:37,653 --> 02:10:40,895
No you've got to have ensemble of identical system

1979
02:10:41,246 --> 02:10:43,272
to do anything like this

1980
02:10:43,635 --> 02:10:46,184
You just prepare each one the same way

1981
02:10:46,520 --> 02:10:47,912
You do a experiment 

1982
02:10:48,255 --> 02:10:49,584
He doesn't care about Alice 

1983
02:10:49,922 --> 02:10:52,040
he's just gonna measure his spin along some axis

1984
02:10:52,384 --> 02:10:54,464
Another one axis  another one axis

1985
02:10:54,752 --> 02:10:57,856
Until he find the one way  he keeps repeatedly getting the same answer

1986
02:10:58,189 --> 02:11:01,392
And then he said that's the direction that spin is polarized 

1987
02:11:01,704 --> 02:11:04,030
And then he keeps doing it and finds consistency 

1988
02:11:04,366 --> 02:11:07,960
He will never find that unless he  says a product state

1989
02:11:08,300 --> 02:11:15,539
So it's pretty interesting stuff  hard stuff

1990
02:11:15,887 --> 02:11:20,555
